PROTECTING THE MOUNTAINS AND COMMUNITIES YOU LOVE
In 2017, we announced a bold goal to create a more sustainable future for our guests, our resorts, our employees, and most importantly, our planet. The 2022 EpicPromise Progress Report outlines our progress with that goal, and how we're protecting mountain communities where we work and play, fighting climate change and supporting our employees. 
SEE THE FULL REPORT
 
COMMITMENT TO ZERO
It's an ambitious feat, but we believe we can achieve a zero net operating footprint by 2030 – which includes zero net emissions, zero waste to landfill and zero net operating impact on forests and habitat. 
EXPLORE IMPACT
 
CLIMATE ADVOCACY
We're making sustainability a group effort. For example, we partnered with over 100 companies at the LEAD On Climate 2022 advocacy day to urge lawmakers in Congress to adopt clean energy solutions. 
LEARN WHY
 
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY
In 2022, the renewable energy projects we enabled produced enough electricity to cover 100% of our North American operations. 
FIND OUT HOW
 
ZERO WASTE TO LANDFILL
On the ground, our resort teams are finding creative ways to reduce waste while improving the resorts. For example, Northstar transformed 23 retired towers from the Comstock lift into terrain park features when the lift was renovated. 
LEARN MORE
 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Of course, these initiatives aren't possible without funding, so this year, we made our largest capital investment to date towards energy efficiency, totaling $3.6M, which will save over 27,000 MMBtu at 20 resorts.

Subject: "If you talk about a prayer sandwich, I'll knock you out!"
Date: November 28, 2022 at 4:37:36 PM MST
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Bcc: Bryant0918@gmail.com

Buenas tardes!

It's been a crazy last few weeks here in Hurricane. Time is flying by!

Elder Pearson came, went and LOADED us up with some very inspired council. We are still all trying to digest and apply what he has instructed us to do. A few highlights that stood out to me were:
- "Part of being successful is not focusing on how you feel, but what needs to get done."
- "Focus is everything."
- NNN rule. Never never never interact with anyone without asking for referrals
- Agency willingly given up to the Lord (obedience/sacrifice) is how we receive power
- Testimony has a VERY short shelf life
- "Faith is a gift from God bestowed as a reward for personal righteousness." Bruce R Mcconkie
- Activity vs Accomplishment (which type of missionary am I?)
- Faith minus Destructive Doubts = Net Faith
- "Hard work reveals capacity."
- Focus teaching on having spiritual experiences and specific invitations.
- "It's not against the Word of Wisdom to talk to people on P-day"
- "If you talk about a prayer sandwich, I'll knock you out!"
- "When is finding time? Anytime you are conscious."

As far as the area goes, we have a lot of momentum going into the month of December. Elder Kingrey and I are spending a good chunk of our time in the Sand Hallow Trailer Parks. I am in heaven! There are 230 trailers there and ~80% of the residents are Latinos. Gold mine! We recently had a ward blitz in that trailer park and it was very successful. How it worked was that some of our members knocked a bunch of doors for us and set up appointments for us to come back in a day or two. We've definitely been seeing the fruits of involving the ward members in finding new people to teach.

Our friend Heidi (from Columbia) got baptized last week! And I got to go back to my last area to baptize Carlos Portilla, who I taught back with Elder Zimerman. Both of the services were super powerful, however the water in the font at both was FREEZING! Heidi even got sick from how cold the water was... Keep her in your prayers.

Our friend Jose wasn't able to get baptized this past Saturday, which was a big bummer. He let us know that he is most likely going to be moving back to California because of how cold it is here. We will send over missionaries in Cali to keep helping him work towards his goal of baptism. 

7 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all—for behold, the atime is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.
Alma 7:7

I read this scripture this past week and we've been sharing it a lot during door contacts & first lessons. It's a great reminder to all of us that our purpose as missionaries and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is to prepare ourselves and the world for the second coming of Jesus Christ. We know not when he will come, only that he will come. 

If you knew Christ was coming tomorrow, what would you change today?

Elder Rasmussen

Dear Bryant,
 
It has been a little while since we last contacted you regarding the Biophysics Graduate Program at the University of Notre Dame. Our deadline for applications is soon approaching, December 1, 2022. 
We invite you to take a closer look at the Biophysics Graduate Program and invite you to apply to the program with no application fee, by using the fee waiver code, "BPHY48". Further details about the faculty and research clusters, as well as an online application, can be found at http://biophysics.nd.edu.  The Biophysics Graduate Program is a relatively new cross-departmental Ph.D. program that trains students at the boundaries between the traditional disciplines of biology, physics, chemistry and applied mathematics.
The University of Notre Dame has outstanding research facilities, including state-of-the-art instrumentation and laboratories. Our faculty are recognized leaders in their respective fields who have dedicated their careers to guiding the development of graduate students into independent scientists. Alumni of our graduate programs hold a broad range of positions in academia, industry and other sectors. The diversity of faculty research interests provides our students with a broad interdisciplinary background, and considerable choice and flexibility in class choices and research projects. 
The graduate stipend for the 2022/2023 academic year is $34,428 (twelve-month appointment). The Biophysics Program covers the full stipend for the first year, alleviating the need for first year students to accept teaching assistant positions. Funding in subsequent years is provided by the student’s research advisor. Tuition costs, which currently amount to about $60,044 are paid in full by the Graduate School for all students in our program. Health insurance fees are also fully covered for Biophysics graduate students.  Please feel free to contact me at biophys@nd.edu if you have any questions about the program, or contact our faculty if you have questions about their research interests and current projects. For technical help submitting your application, please email gradapp@nd.edu.
I hope you will consider the Notre Dame Biophysics Program for your graduate studies.
Best regards,
Alan E. Lindsay Associate Professor of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics Director, Biophysics Graduate Program University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA

Subject: University of Oxford: Graduate application started
Date: November 28, 2022 at 12:07:23 PM MST
To: bryant0918@gmail.com

Dear Bryant McArthur
Thank you for starting your application for the MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford, for entry in 2023/24. Oxford offers the opportunity to join an outstanding academic community, and we look forward to receiving your application. 
Completing your application
Visit our A-Z list of courses to find full details of your course, including entry requirements, deadlines and required documents. Before continuing your application form, we strongly recommend that you:
	•	Research your course entry requirements and make sure that you will be able to make a competitive application
	•	Read the 'How to apply' section on the relevant course page for details of the supporting documents required and ensure that you adhere to word limits
	•	Read the Application Guide
	•	Obtain final or interim transcripts for your higher education qualifications as soon as possible, as some institutions may take several weeks to produce them
	•	Contact your referees straightaway to ensure they are willing to submit a reference by the deadline and register them as soon as they agree
When should I submit my application?
Aim to submit your application well ahead of the application deadline so that Graduate Admissions can check that the documents meet our requirements. If you apply at least a week before the deadline, we will endeavour to email you before the deadline if anything further is required.
Submit all documents required for your application, including official transcripts, by the deadline. Documents that do not meet the requirements will be removed. References must also be received by that date. Your submitted application will then be considered ready for assessment.
Applications missing any required documents, including references, will not normally be assessed by the academic department.
You can log in at any point to access your application. After submitting, you will be able to manage your application via our 'Graduate Applicant Self Service' online portal, which you will be able to access via your application account.
Funding your studies
It is never too early to start thinking about funding for your study. To find out how to give yourself the best chance of securing funding, take a look at our funding information.
Please make sure that you have done everything required to be considered for our scholarship funding. For candidates who have applied by the funding deadline for their course (please check the course page for the funding deadline), the University expects to be able to offer around 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships for new students.
For over two thirds of Oxford scholarships if you fulfil the eligibility criteria and apply for your course by the relevant funding deadline, you will be automatically considered as part of the standard admissions process. Our Fees, Funding and Scholarship Search will show you scholarships which require you to submit a separate application.
Further information
Most of the information you need is in the Application Guide or is covered by our extensive bank of Frequently Asked Questions. If you cannot find the answer to your question, please contact us via the link below. Please use the email address registered on your application if you do need to email us.

The Colorado Springs shooting.

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 13 minutes.
👮‍♂️
In today's edition of Tangle, we're going to be breaking down the Colorado Springs shooting and what we know about it. We also have the news you missed over Thanksgiving, an opportunity to tell your story to Tangle readers, and a fascinating "under the radar" section. We're skipping our reader question today.

Trying something new... 
I want to get to know my readers and listeners better. So I've decided to do something interesting: I'm going to interview five random Tangle readers/listeners and publish those interviews as a podcast and transcription. The conversations will run during our holiday break around Christmas and the New Year.
The idea is simple: Five conversations with five people who read Tangle. We'll talk about life, politics, how they ended up chatting with me, and simply get to know them. I think it'll be a really interesting experiment.
How I'll choose: Randomly (for the most part). If you want to be a candidate for an interview, fill out this survey. I'll put every email address into a digital hat and then let a computer simulation pick five winners. I will try to diversify the kinds of people I chat with, but will mostly let the numbers pick. Then we'll set up a time to chat remotely and go from there. You can fill out the form by clicking here. We’ll be taking submissions until Friday.

Today's topic.
The Colorado Springs shooting. Last week, five people were killed and nineteen more were injured when a shooter opened fire inside a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs. The 22-year-old suspect made their first court appearance via video call on Wednesday.
Editor's note: Tangle does not name mass shooters because of the well documented contagion effect. For similar reasons, we also try to share limited information about the shooter and their alleged motives, where possible. In this case, the 22-year-old suspect's lawyers say they identify as nonbinary, so — like other news organizations — we will refer to them with they/them pronouns in this article.
Police say the alleged shooter walked into Club Q in Colorado Springs around midnight last Saturday and began firing an AR-15 style rifle. The shooter, who also possessed a handgun during the attack, was subdued by patrons of the club who tackled them to the ground. One of the attendees of the club who brought the shooter down was an army veteran who was at the club watching a drag show with his wife, daughter and some friends.
Police, prosecutors and defense attorneys have not yet made a case for the motive of the attack. The five killed in the shooting were Raymond Green Vance, Kelly Loving, Daniel Aston, Derrick Rump and Ashley Paugh.
The alleged shooter did not have a significant internet presence, though they did frequent a far-right internet forum where they had been bullied about their weight. The suspect is also the grandson of Randy Voepel, the outgoing California Assemblyman, according to several news reports.
Last year, they had weapons seized from their home after holding members of their own family hostage at gunpoint. The alleged shooter's mother said they also threatened to hurt the family with a homemade bomb, which led to an arrest but no charges. Colorado has red flag laws designed to prevent people with violent criminal histories from purchasing firearms, but it's still not known if the weapons in this case were purchased legally, or whether they were bought before or after the incident from last year.
Authorities did say red flag laws were not used when the alleged shooter's weapons were confiscated.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions from the left and right to the shooting, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left point to "moral panic" from conservatives about drag shows and transgender people as a potential contributor the violence.
	•	Some call out the uniquely American problem of mass shootings and suggest our gun laws need further overhaul.
	•	Others say right-wing violence is going to proliferate because the conservative movement is failing.
In The New York Times, columnist Michelle Goldberg argued that the shooting is “hard to separate” from the right's fixation on drag shows.
"In recent years, the right has become increasingly fixated on all-ages drag shows, part of a growing moral panic about children being 'groomed' into gender nonconformity," Goldberg said. "Club Q hosted a drag show on Saturday night and had an all-ages drag brunch scheduled for Sunday. Perhaps we’ll learn something in the coming days that will put these murders, which took place on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance, into a new light, but right now, it seems hard to separate them from a nationwide campaign of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. incitement. During the early years of Donald Trump’s administration, conservatives downplayed the contempt for homosexuality and gender nonconformity that had once been central to their movement, foregrounding racial resentment instead.
"Opposition to gay marriage had become a political loser, and it was hard to pose as champions of wholesome family values while enthusiastically supporting a thrice-married libertine who’d made a cameo in soft-core porn. But in recent years, as growing numbers of kids started identifying as trans, the puritanical tendency on the right has come roaring back, part of an increasingly apocalyptic worldview that sees the erosion of traditional gender roles as a harbinger of national collapse," she wrote. "The language of 'grooming' recapitulated old homophobic tropes about gay people recruiting children, while also playing into the newer delusions of QAnon, which holds that elite liberals are part of a sprawling satanic child abuse ring. Conservatives hoped to turn this conspiracy theory into political power; according to the Human Rights Campaign, Republicans and Republican-aligned groups spent at least $50 million on anti-L.G.B.T.Q. ads in the midterms."
In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Will Bunch put the shooting in the context of rising anger on the right because they are losing.
"In normal times, the horror that was perpetrated a week ago at Club Q would have triggered a flood of 'thoughts and prayers' from some of the worst Republicans who’d sought to normalize political hatred toward the LGBTQ community during the 2022 midterms — but maybe also some actual heartfelt talk of dialing back the rhetoric," he said. "Just 11 years later, there was no such reckoning after Colorado Springs. To the contrary, the right was doubling down in its attacks against drag shows of the type that took place at Club Q, on the transgender community, and against LGBTQ culture in general... The dead in Colorado hadn’t yet been buried and [Tucker] Carlson followed his brief, tepid condemnation of the killer with an on-screen graphic 'STOP SEXUALIZING KIDS!' and the shocking take that shootings will continue ‘until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children.’
"It’s true that we don’t know the exact motivation of the Club Q shooter — a young person with a muddled and confusing background — but we do know they were raised in a family that has openly embraced political violence and homophobia. The killer’s grandfather, an outgoing California GOP state lawmaker named Randy Voepel, compared the Jan. 6 insurrection to the American Revolution — 'the first shots fired against tyranny.' The gunman’s dad, tracked down by a San Diego TV reporter, expressed no remorse for the nightclub massacre. Instead, he claimed to be relieved because he determined his child ... 'is not gay, so I said, ‘Phew.’... I am a conservative Republican.' ... The antisemitism, the homophobia, the violence ... this isn’t the American right flexing its muscles out of strength. Quite the opposite. The forces of 400 years of white supremacy culture are like a wounded bear right now — lashing out, and extremely dangerous because its proponents know they are a seriously endangered species."
The Washington Post editorial board pleaded with Americans to be honest about guns.
"The United States has averaged nearly two mass shootings a day this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which tracks when four or more people are shot. To put that another way, it’s now unusual to have a day without a mass shooting," the board said. "It can happen anywhere, to anyone. Fourteen Americans mowed down this month at the University of Virginia, Club Q in Colorado Springs and a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va., were doing normal activities of daily life — going to school, enjoying a performance, working. They leave behind grieving loved ones, who ask: Why? In each case, as usually happens, there were warning signs missed — or ignored.
"The chilling note the Walmart shooter left in his phone railing against his co-workers and claiming his phone was hacked suggests he was a deeply disturbed 31-year-old. And yet, he was able to buy a pistol just hours before he massacred six fellow employees in a break room. In Colorado Springs, a 22-year-old suspect who had been arrested last year for an alleged bomb threat, but never prosecuted, was not prevented from obtaining an AR-15-style weapon and a handgun," the board said. "It’s eerily similar in the University of Virginia shooting: The 22-year-old suspect had multiple prior run-ins with the law, including a 2021 conviction for possessing a concealed firearm without a license... Too often these tragedies are written off to individual cases of mental illness. That does not explain why the United States has had more than 600 mass shootings every year since 2020 and why no other country has anything close to this level of gun violence."

What the right is saying.
	•	The right criticized the left for blaming conservatives when we still don't know what the shooter's motive was.
	•	Some argued that new laws aren't needed, but the story is actually one of law enforcement failures.
	•	Others argued the instant blaming of the right without more information is what will actually lead to more political violence.
National Review's editors criticized the instant politicization of the event — and assumptions about the shooter's motive.
"Club Q was an LGBT club 'where families of all ages gathered for brunch on Sundays to watch drag performers,' the Washington Post reported. According to the burgeoning conventional wisdom, therefore, the true culprits for the Club Q shooting include Libs of Tik Tok, Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk’s Twitter content-moderation policies, the 'right wing moral panic' about drag queen story hours, and — of course — the entire Republican Party," the editors said. "It is grotesque to lay the blame for this shooting at the feet of the millions of Americans who have legitimate questions about children being exposed to drag shows or undergoing irreversible sex-change surgeries. The idea that those questions are not just beyond the pale, but are affirmatively responsible for the murder of gay and transgender Americans, is a shameless attempt to gain an edge in an ongoing culture-war debate.
"In 2017, a Tennessee woman attempted to run a Republican congressman off the road for his support for the GOP’s Obamacare replacement bill. A month later, a former Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer opened fire on a number of House Republicans, putting House whip Steve Scalise in the hospital for six weeks. Sanders had previously argued that if the GOP’s health-care bill passed, 'thousands of Americans would die' — a claim echoed by numerous top Democrats. Are they responsible for the attempted murders of their partisan opponents? Of course not," they wrote. "From the 2012 shooting at the Family Research Council to the 2022 arrest of an armed assassin outside of Brett Kavanaugh’s house, political violence on the left is never seriously treated as the fruits of left-wing rhetoric."
In The Washington Examiner, Zachary Faria blamed "another law enforcement failure" that gun control wouldn't solve.
"A gunman in Colorado Springs killed five people and injured 18, and unsurprisingly, he was already on law enforcement’s radar. In June 2021, he allegedly threatened his mother with a homemade bomb. Neighbors were forced to evacuate from their homes, and a bomb squad and crisis negotiators were brought in," Faria said. "And yet, according to the Associated Press, 'there’s no public record that prosecutors moved forward with felony kidnapping and menacing charges.' Instead, charges were dropped. The shooter was out on the streets with seemingly no restrictions and no felonies on his record, meaning it is entirely possible that the firearms he used in the shooting were purchased by him legally, as CNN claimed law enforcement believes.
"There is also no indication that Colorado’s red flag law was ever used by the shooter’s family or by law enforcement to remove firearms from his possession. Colorado has also had universal background checks in place since 2013, and an 'assault weapons' ban would have done little given that the shooter was also armed with a handgun," Faria wrote. "Yet again, it appears that none of the Democratic Party’s favorite gun control ideas would have done anything to prevent this shooting... This has been par for the course... The Washington Post determined in 2015 that no mainstream gun control proposals would have prevented mass shootings, and a follow-up in 2022 essentially reached the same conclusion. As usual, we have red flags around shooters being ignored and existing gun control laws failing or simply being ineffective."
In USA Today, Ingrid Jacques said we should pause and mourn before immediately trying to demonize one another.
"On Wednesday morning, I woke up to an NPR news report linking the deadly weekend shooting at a Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub with conservative-backed legislation regarding gay and transgender policies. There was no proof of this serious charge, yet it was pronounced as fact," Jacques wrote. "NPR is far from the only news outlet making these claims. Headline after headline the past few days has made similar allegations. It strikes me as incredibly sad that as a country we can’t come together to mourn such senseless violence without immediately pointing fingers at one another. It’s also dangerous to assume blame and motive, and the knee-jerk instinct to quash serious debates – especially ones taking place [about] curriculum in public schools – is a threat to our freedom of speech.
"As someone in the business of words, I know that what we say does matter and that words hold power. And hate is real – but the tendency to stereotype and ostracize others falls on both sides of the political spectrum," she said. "Not all policy discussions around LGBTQ issues, however, deserve the label 'hate.' It’s a mistake to paint all Republicans (and parents) who may have concerns over what children are learning in school and how gender identity affects sports teams as perpetrators of hate and violence... In a social media world where news spreads like wildfire, journalists and politicians have a special obligation not to fuel false or uncertain narratives. Otherwise, the hate and distrust that fracture our country will deepen. And that, sadly, may lead to even more violence."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	We still don't have a motive. Full stop.
	•	It is important to discuss the failures of the people around the shooter, our laws, and our law enforcement.
	•	Pundits on the right should reckon with the fact right-wing violence is much more common today than left-wing violence, even if this isn't an example. 
Unfortunately, we've had to cover many of these mass shootings now. And my response is typically the same: It's unbelievably disheartening to watch them happen, it's important to build "blame pyramids" for responsibility, and it is absolutely within our power to do something about this.
As I wrote after Uvalde and Buffalo, it's hard to deny that our country is broken. We can't pretend there is nothing we can do when what happens here is so utterly unique and horrifying. We don't have to pretend mass shootings make up a large chunk of gun deaths (they are a tiny fraction) in order to recognize the traumatizing impact they have on society as a whole.
Recently, every time a shooting like this has happened, a familiar pattern has played out. Democrats blame loose gun laws and increasingly hysterical rhetoric from the right for motivating a killer. Republicans respond by pointing to unenforced gun control measures already in place and left-wing violence, reminding liberals they don't blame that violence on increasingly hysterical rhetoric from the left.
My take is a little different. When I talk about “blame pyramids,” I mean emphasizing where the most responsibility lies and building out the various dynamics of fault from there.
First and foremost, the responsibility for these attacks always lies primarily with the person holding the gun. Individuals make decisions to act violently and we should center the responsibility on them, lest we reinforce the idea for future mass shooters that they are justified or were left no choice due to societal ills. Whether it is a mass shooter, gang violence, a police killing, a domestic dispute or a suicide, there is a person with a gun making a decision. We should assess them and their choices first.
Secondarily, and seldom mentioned, is the responsibility of families and immediate social circles. We don't yet know the motive of the Club Q mass shooter. We do know, as in the cases of many, many others before them, that there were warning signs. There were opportunities for intervention. There were chances to disarm, to get this person help, to ensure they were flagged in the system, and in this case, even to put this person behind bars before they could do harm. Their social circle appears to have utterly failed.
It is my belief that the third layer of blame rests in our laws. I've written before about the idea of friction — how multi-billion dollar companies spend endless amounts of money trying to reduce friction for consumers. In too many states in America, buying a gun is a very low-friction event. I believe more friction would make us safer. As someone who enjoys guns, sees their role in society, and believes strongly in the value of preserving our Second Amendment rights, I also think we can have far more friction than we do right now without infringing on those rights. Frankly, I think it is absurd to believe otherwise.
Key to this layer of blame, though, is the enforcement of those laws. Our background check system is riddled with flaws. Local police, military, federal and state courts, and hospitals are regularly failing to report records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In this case, it is unfathomable that the alleged shooter was not reported in Colorado's red flag system. This is precisely the kind of person who must be prevented from obtaining or possessing any gun legally, and if it comes out that they did buy or possess this gun legally, it will be the latest indictment of that system.
Earlier this year, Democrats and a few Republicans passed a gun safety measure that called for more mental health funding and expanded background checks on 18 to 21 year olds who are trying to buy guns. It also beefed up funding for the kinds of laws that allow the seizure of weapons from people with troubled or violent records. This was a good intervention, the results of which will take time to see as it’s implemented. In the meantime, we need to better enforce the laws we already have on the books.
Fourth and finally is the rhetoric in our current political moment. Our general cultural environment is not the most important factor in gun deaths, but I'm not going to sit here and say alarmist rhetoric is blameless for what happens. It comes both from nationally syndicated pundits and the dark corners of the internet. I am certain that it plays some role. In this case, we still don't have a motive from the shooter, and I'm not going to invent one until authorities give us an indication of what their investigation finds. It could have been a personal dispute, it could have been fervent anti-LGTBQ mania, or it could have been something else. We just don't know.
What I can say is that our rhetoric matters, even if it is at the bottom of my blame pyramid. When we published our deep dive on which party is more extreme this summer, one of the things I noted is that the data strongly suggests extreme right-wing violence is much more common than extreme left-wing violence. It'd make my job easier here if this wasn't the case and I could scold both sides equally for their actions — but that'd simply be a lie. This isn't a partisan talking point but a reflection of what the FBI tells us about domestic threats. It's an uncomfortable truth. And right-wing pundits who regularly broad brush entire communities as pedophiles and threats to our children have to reckon with the fact it only takes one unstable person with a weak support system to act on that hyperbolic language for an act of mass violence to be committed.
But again: This isn't a uniquely right-wing problem. Threats to Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the 2017 Congressional baseball shooting are easy reminders of that. When our politicians and pundits speak in increasingly hysterical terms about our political opponents — insisting their actions are going to harm our children, destroy society or end our lives — it is only logical for the few people who take them at face value to take action.
For now, we have to wait for more information about how and why the shooter in Colorado Springs did what they did. But when we find out, we should use the information to learn, adapt and hold each other more accountable, not simply dismiss this as something that is impossible to prevent or entirely unpredictable.

Under the radar.
Lawmakers and agriculture groups are working hard to pass an overhaul of the farmworker visa program before the GOP takes control of the House of Representatives next year. A bill providing a path to citizenship for some one million farmworkers that would create a capped number of new year-round visas has already passed the House, and is now being circulated in the Senate. The measure is supported by many immigrant advocacy organizations, as well as farm groups who say they badly need more laborers to harvest their crops. Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) are trying to reach an agreement to secure 60 votes in Biden's lame duck session. The Wall Street Journal has the story.

Numbers. 
	•	42. The number of mass shootings (in which four or more people are shot) in November so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
	•	40,252. The total number of gun deaths in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
	•	21,912. The number of gun deaths this year that were suicides.
	•	617. The number of mass shootings to date in the U.S. in 2022.  
	•	269. The number of mass shootings in the U.S. in all of 2014.

Have a nice day.
The U.S. Coast Guard made one of its most remarkable rescues ever after a cruise ship passenger fell overboard near Southwest Pass, Louisiana. A 28-year-old man had been in the water for hours after falling from a ship heading to Cozumel, Mexico. He had gone to the bar at 11 p.m. on Wednesday night and didn't return, and his sister didn't report him missing until the next day. The U.S. Coast Guard found a person 20 miles off the coast. In the incredible image below, you can barely make out his head in the water (to the left of the crosshairs). The man reportedly spent 15 hours in the ocean before being found. BBC News has the remarkable story.

Hello Bryant,

Duke Kunshan University's Global Health Program consists of two major components – the Master of Science in Global Health and the Global Health Research Center. 

Over the past few years, our faculty, researchers and students have embarked on several projects in collaboration with academic institutions, government agencies and the private sectors in China and around the world. We have worked passionately to generate knowledge that will bolster our ability to fight diseases and improve public health by strengthening health systems.

  

Outside the classroom setting, we provide comprehensive academic support to help you achieve success. We host seminars each week with prestigious scholars and professors from around the world, organize field trips to hospitals and research sites to help students put theory into practice, and offer walk-in hours for students to have one-on-one conversations with faculty and receive mentorship from their advisers. 
 
  

We provide funding for students to conduct 10 weeks of fieldwork under the mentorship of their adviser and an onsite supervisor. So far, our graduates have conducted fieldwork suited to their interests in more than 20 countries on six continents.

* Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. iPhone activation required on iPhone purchases made at an Apple Store with one of these national carriers: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, or T-Mobile. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. Available for qualifying applicants in the United States. If you reside in the U.S. territories, please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about accessing this offer or applying for Apple Card. Except for ACMI, this offer cannot be combined with other Apple promotion(s) or financing offers that are directed to individual end-user customers in the qualifying location. This offer also cannot be combined with the Apple Employee Purchase Plan or business loyalty pricing. Some method of payment types are not accepted under this offer. See checkout for details. Availability of in-store promotion offerings may be limited by Apple Store location closures as a result of COVID-19. Additional restrictions apply. View full terms and conditions of offer here. 
1. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase or added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all stores and may vary between in-store and online trade-in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of any trade-in transaction for any reason.

Find a store to view local store hours or see checkout for estimated delivery. A signature is required for delivery. Drivers may ask for verbal confirmation of receipt from a safe distance to satisfy the signature requirement. 
3. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S. to select at checkout for certain Apple products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE and is subject to credit approval and credit limit.

Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI and are subject to your card’s variable APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. iPhone activation required on iPhone purchases made at an Apple Store with one of these national carriers: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, or T-Mobile.

Hey Snackers,
Holiday travel can be stressful, especially when you’re trying to check your pet through TSA. Screening officers at JFK identified a live orange cat stuffed in a trolley. They weren’t feline it.
Stocks inched up for the short week after Fed officials suggested they might reduce the size of future rate hikes. Investors are eyeing Black Friday sales as the holiday shopping season kicks off.

PUNT
The NFL and Amazon invest in sports-adjacent content to lure fans with “companion” shows
MVP of the season… “companion content.” Sports shows like Netflix’s “Drive to Survive” (about Formula 1 racers) have become hugely popular as younger sports fans seek new ways to engage. Now, more media giants are looking to capitalize on the companion-content craze:
	•	Working overtime: This month Amazon struck a deal to stream games of high-school b-ball league Overtime Elite on Prime — and produce a companion docu-series.
	•	Hail Maverick: Also this month, the NFL teamed up with Skydance Media (the studio behind “Top Gun: Maverick”) to make original sports content like docs and shows.
Getting in the game… is more important — and more expensive — than ever. As Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, and Comcast-owned Peacock compete for streaming supremacy, they’ve struck pricey live-broadcasting deals with the NFL, MLB, and MLS to attract subscribers. The amount paid for US sports broadcasting rights surpassed $21B this year, a 26% jump from 2019.
	•	Bidding bonanza: Netflix recently lost its bid for Formula 1 streaming rights to Disney, which lost a separate bid for Indian cricket rights.
	•	Joining the little leagues: To save money, Netflix has reportedly considered streaming more niche sports like pro surfing and cycling.
	•	More bang for less buck: For streaming titans, sports-adjacent content could bring the popularity of live sports without the big broadcasting price tag.
 
THE TAKEAWAY
Adjacency = opportunity… because fans love to get up close and personal with their favorite stars. Social-media-adjacent businesses like OnlyFans, Patreon, and Cameo succeeded by giving superfollowers an exclusive peek (beyond the social page). Gaming-adjacent Twitch took off by giving fans interactive access to top gamers with livestreams. Streaming giants are betting on sports-adjacent content for the same reason: they know fans love getting an inside look.

EVENTS
Coming up this week...
Like an Advent calendar… Instead of chocolate, the surprise is labor market #s. On Friday, the Labor Department will release unemployment data for November. In October, the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7% and stocks reacted positively (bad news = good news). While unemployment’s still near historic lows, we saw a fresh wave of layoffs this month, from Twitter to Amazon to Meta (Google might be next). But tech openings are still above prepandemic levels, and widespread layoffs across industries remain low. That could be changing: last week’s jobless claims hit their highest level since August.
Not-so-silver cloud lining… Shares of Salesforce, Snowflake, and Workday have lost nearly half their value this year as higher interest rates curb cloud spend. Salesforce's revenue rose 22% last quarter, but it cut its full-year forecast as the strong US dollar (and slowing demand) pressure profits. But as tech layoffs pile up, companies are still investing in cloud software to help them do more with less. Cloud spend is forecast to grow 21% next year, but analysts aren’t expecting breakthrough results when the cloud companies report this week.

ZOOM OUT
Stories we’re watching...
Status-symbol cuffs are in… Despite global gloom, luxury jewelers like Cartier, Bulgari, and Tiffany are growing as branded bling booms. Last year the luxe jewelry market grew 7% from prepandemic totals. Bulgari’s planning to double production at its massive Italian jewelry factory, and Cartier is looking to open two new plants next year. Even fashion-focused Prada is launching its first jewelry collection. Branded pieces like Cartier Love bracelets are driving demand more than nameless gems.
FTX-tra messy… Lawyers for bankrupt crypto exchange FTX went to court last week to explain just how bad the company's books are. Think: a "substantial amount" of customers' crypto was stolen or is just straight up missing — that kind of bad. The Bahamian-based exchange owes $3B+ to its top 50 creditors (but hasn't publicly identified them). If they're institutional players (like crypto lenders), that bad debt could supercharge contagion. Meanwhile, customer funds remain frozen, and experts say sorting through FTX's mess could take years.

ICYMI
Last week's highlights...
	•	Bobs: The old Bob gets his old job: Disney icon Bob Iger shocked the entertainment industry by announcing his return as CEO (Bob Chapek is out). The surprise move proves brand makers are hard to replace.
	•	Offside: World Cup host Qatar has kicked off controversy, from anti-LGBTQ+ moves to alcohol bans in stadiums. Despite vocal opposition, sponsors like Budweiser and Adidas aren’t willing to ditch one of the world’s top advertising opportunities.
	•	Fitch: Abercrombie's back with a cologne-scented vengeance: Abercrombie and American Eagle shares soared last week after the tween-friendly retailers posted uplifting results as they overhauled inventories.

What else we're Snackin'
	•	Taxing: Tax-prep services like H&R Block, TaxAct, and TaxSlayer reportedly sent users' info — in some cases names, incomes, and refund amounts — to Meta, which uses personal data to fuel its targeted ads biz.
	•	Checked: The raises are coming: employers plan to increase salary budgets by more than 4% next year. But with inflation nearly at 8%, that bump might not be enough to boost purchasing power.
	•	Spend: FTX and its then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried spent millions on political donations and consultants. Recipients are now distancing themselves as SBF goes from "white knight" to pariah.

This week’s pro tip:
Don’t discount your previous experiences.
You may think some of your college or work experiences aren’t relevant, but if you held a summer job, helped with a campus organization, or worked with a study group, that can show recruiters you gained transferable skills (AKA skills that can be used in an internship or full-time role).

Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted Eligible Product.

Your Chance To Discover Something More

Dear Bryant,
When choosing a graduate program, it's important to consider the opportunities it will provide you. Most importantly, you'll want to make sure that the school you select will allow you to build upon the skills you already possess and discover new ways to apply this learning in the real world.
Drexel's unique approach, which combines a comprehensive interdisciplinary education with a focus on application, allows you to develop a conceptual expertise — while providing opportunities to actively apply this advanced knowledge in real-world situations. You'll work collaboratively with your professors, mentors, and fellow students to test established methodologies and explore new ideas, then have the chance to match concept to practice in laboratories, neighborhood classrooms, nursing centers, and more. You can also take advantage of our vast professional network of brands, employers, and Dragon alumni, which provides the chance to develop relationships and make meaningful connections with the leaders of your field.
This emphasis on practical experience and idea sharing is the foundation of a Drexel education. Whether your ultimate goal is to advance your career, participate in groundbreaking research endeavors, or to enter a new field, graduate studies at Drexel will prepare you to push the boundaries of what you can achieve. Check out our video, What You Bring to the Table, to learn more about everything Drexel has to offer.
The next generation of leadership begins right here. And the time is right now. We hope you'll be a part of it.
Sincerely,
Angela L. Montgomery, PhD Assistant Vice President, Graduate Admissions

Subject: Let Us Help Make Coming To The iSchool A Reality [Costs + Aid]

Greetings Bryant,
If you’re thinking about coming to the iSchool, we want to help you make it a reality.
Whether it’s campus activities, research projects, career placement, or something else, we’re committed to giving students just like you every opportunity you need to make Syracuse a launching pad for the rest of your life.
However, we know the cost alone can make grad school a massive decision. That’s why we offer scholarships, fellowships, and a variety of other types of financial aid to many of our students.
Here’s what you can do:
	1.	Check out the cost breakdown on our website
	2.	Look for graduate scholarships and awards
	3.	Discuss loan options with a financial aid officers
	4.	Don’t forget to ask your employer about tuition assistance
The last thing that should prevent you from taking your place at the iSchool is cost. Take a few minutes to read about the awards and aid we offer — and if you have any questions, hit “reply” and send us a message at any time.  If you'd like to connect with our admissions team, faculty and current students, explore our virtual visit opportunities.  Kind regards,  Zachary Schuster Director for Graduate Admissions and Recruitment School of Information Studies  igrad@syr.edu  P.S. We’re always available for a 1-on-1 meeting to answer your questions and explore the right options for you. Make an appointment today!

* Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more information.

Except for ACMI, this offer cannot be combined with other Apple promotion(s) or financing offers that are directed to individual end-user customers in the qualifying location.

Nosso compromisso de combater a violência de gênero 

Saiba mais
 
 
Almejamos em um mundo onde todas as mulheres possam ir e vir a qualquer lugar, sem restrições e sem medo. 
Por isso, queremos ajudar com soluções que as fazem se sentir mais seguras.

Para ajudar a resolver problemas complexos como este, trabalhamos em parceria com especialistas em projetos dentro e fora da plataforma.

 
Uma mudança cultural a partir da educação 
 
O assédio é um problema global e uma realidade cotidiana de todas as mulheres. Você pode ajudar a combater isso.

Essa iniciativa de educação busca conscientizar e prevenir comportamentos inadequados que não são tolerados na plataforma.

Assista aos conteúdos educativos que criamos em colaboração com organizações especializadas para que parceiros e usuários recebam recomendações específicas sobre o que não fazer no app da Uber.

Parcerias com organizações especializadas 
 
A complexidade e abrangência da violência contra as mulheres é uma preocupação de todos.

Na Uber acreditamos que o setor privado pode contribuir e por isso desde 2018 atuamos em parceria com diversas organizações especializadas no tema.

Como parte dos #16DiasdeAtivismo, convidamos você a conhecer os projetos e organizações que buscam melhorar a vida das mulheres brasileiras:

MeToo Brasil:
Em parceria com o MeToo Brasil, desenvolvemos um canal de suporte psicológico para atender vítimas de violência de gênero em nossa comunidade. Qualquer pessoa que sofra algum tipo de assédio ou discriminação durante o uso da plataforma, tem acesso ao acolhimento após relatar o incidente no app da Uber.

Instituto Avon
Apoiamos o desenvolvimento da Ângela, uma assistente virtual criada em 2020, que ajuda mulheres em situação de violência doméstica ou pessoas que queiram ajudar uma mulher nessa situação. Além disso, a Uber segue disponibilizando códigos promocionais para que essas mulheres se desloquem com independência em busca de ajuda.

Instituto Igarapé
Apoiamos a criação e atualização anual da plataforma EVA, que coleta e disponibiliza dados sobre violência contra as mulheres no Brasil, México e Colômbia.

Instituto Patrícia Galvão
Apoiamos o desenvolvimento de quatro pesquisas sobre a segurança das mulheres em seu deslocamento, a relação entre autonomia financeira e ciclo da violência, os impactos da violência na mobilidade da mulher e a relação entre controle e violência doméstica.

Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública
Além de apoiar e participar dos Encontros Anuais com debates qualificados sobre violência de gênero, apoiamos a realização da última pesquisa de vitimização sobre o tema.

U- Elas 
 
Sabemos que a autonomia financeira está relacionada ao ciclo da violência de gênero. A Uber quer ser aliada de cada vez mais mulheres e contribuir para que assumam a direção de suas vidas e tenham uma nova alternativa de geração de renda, conquistando assim seus objetivos e independência.

Por isso lançamos o "U-Elas". Com esse recurso, motoristas parceiras mulheres ou pessoas não-binárias podem decidir quando transportar apenas mulheres.

O recurso pode ser ativado e desativado diretamente pelo app a qualquer hora, pelo tempo e quantas vezes desejarem.
Essas iniciativas fazem parte do nosso compromisso para colaborar com um mundo onde todos e todas se locomovam sem medo.

Hey, Night Lighters!
 
Our Black Friday Sale is LIVE!
 
Our Black Friday event is the most anticipated sale of the year because we announce our new schedule AND the tickets are the lowest price they will be all season.
 
We’ll be at Cedar Lake Cellars on Saturday, October 21st, 2023!
 
Tickets are only $25.50 each and every ticket purchased comes with an extra lantern!
BUY YOUR TIX HERE
 
 
Giving Night Lights tix as a gift?
 

 
Keep in mind…
 
This year we'll be limiting the capacity at each of our events to create a more curated experience — meaning that our events will be selling out, even more, this year!
 
Save yourself money, time, and hassle by locking in your tickets now during our sale… But hurry, this deal won’t last long.
 
Head over and get yours now.

Dear Bryant,  “Surprised.”  That’s the term we hear most often from people visiting Pittsburgh. And we’re confident that you’ll be pleasantly surprised, too.  Pittsburgh consistently ranks among the top places to live, work, and visit in the United States. Individuals in their 20's constitute 24 percent of Pittsburgh’s population, fourth-highest among America’s largest cities. And because of its low cost of living, large concentration of universities and colleges, and recent cultural renaissance, Pittsburgh ranks among the top cities in the U.S. for recent college graduates – making it the ideal place for you to live and learn as you complete your graduate studies.  We are located in the heart of the city. We’re proud to call Pittsburgh “home,” and you will be, too.  But don’t take our word for it: check out all of the great things that Pittsburgh has to offer outside of the classroom.

* Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022.

Dear Family
We have an added reason to celebrate Thanksgiving.  John Howland was one of the 53 pilgrims who survived the arrival on the Mayflower in 1620.  And John Howland is my ancestor.  
The first Thanksgiving, attended by John Howland, was in 1621 with the 53 pilgrims and 90 members of the Wampanoag Tribe.

Thanks to the efforts of Tom Eichelberger, who produced the research and submitted it to the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, I am officially a Mayflower descendant.  Attached is a Certificate of authenticity.
So when we enjoy our meal today, perhaps we'll all feel a little more appreciation for all our blessings.

From Secretary Cardona: Lawsuits are preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing its one-time student loan debt relief program
  Bryant, 
This email provides you with an update on the one-time Student Loan Debt Relief plan that President Biden and I announced on August 24th.
We received your application or have the income information to process you for loan relief. You do not need to take any further action at this time.
Unfortunately, a number of lawsuits have been filed challenging the program, which have blocked our ability to discharge your debt at present. We believe strongly that the lawsuits are meritless, and the Department of Justice has appealed on our behalf. We will keep your application information and will continue our review of your eligibility if and when we prevail in court. We will update you when there are new developments.
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to helping borrowers as they recover from the pandemic.
Education is a great equalizer, and we will never stop fighting for you!
  In Service,  Miguel A. Cardona  U.S. Secretary of Education

Your Testimony: Is It Where You Want It to Be?
 
Our testimonies can go through ups and downs throughout our lives. Sometimes we may feel confident and ready to share it with the world! Other times, we may question if we have a testimony or wonder what we can do to strengthen it.

Dear Bryant,
 
Thank you for being part of the Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) community and team!

We've had some huge successes this year, and big things like these are only possible when lots of people work together. 

In our case, the team includes students, legislators, donors, staff, board, and other partner organizations. 

Together, this year, the YAL team has achieved the biggest wins in our history.

We have...

...DOUBLED our coalition of legislators! (YAL students knocked on over 3.8 million doors to elect pro-liberty legislators over the last 4 years!)

...passed enough legislation to make 91 MILLION Americans more free in 22 states!

...achieved a series of policy wins on college campuses including our 100th win for free speech! (These 100 free speech wins protect the First Amendment rights of over 1.5 million college students each year!)

And so much more.

This year has been phenomenally productive for YAL and for liberty, and I am so thankful for your contributions to this work. 

Building on our work and successes in 2022, next year, together, we have a very realistic chance of making 100 MILLION Americans more free by passing pro-liberty legislation at the state level in 25 states.

The legislation we champion in 2023 will include bills on school choice, Second Amendment protections, criminal justice reform, lower taxes, and so much more. 

Together, we'll be able to do really big things for liberty in 2023. 

Thank you for being part of this winning team and for all that you do for liberty!

From all of us at YAL headquarters, happy Thanksgiving!

Subject: EECS at MIT invites you to a virtual discussion! What makes a PhD application compelling? Monday, Nov. 28 3:30pm ET
Date: November 23, 2022 at 10:05:52 AM MST
To: bryant0918@gmail.com

Dear Bryant Mcarthur:


Hello!
We invite you to join us on Monday, Nov. 28th at 3:30pm ET for a virtual conversation. We will discuss what makes a compelling PhD application with faculty and staff in EECS who, as members of the admission committee, have reviewed 1000s of applications submitted in the past. We will also hear from the Department Head Professor Asu Ozdaglar who will share an overview of the EECS department to highlight the vast array of topics under investigation by our faculty, research staff, graduate students and undergraduate students. Here I want to offer some details of the agenda and share the logistics.

Agenda is as follows:
3:30pm ET: Welcome by Moderator Professor Leslie Kolodziejski, Chair of Graduate Admissions in EECS
3:35pm ET: Overview of EECS at MIT by Department Head Professor Asu Ozdaglar
3:48pm ET: Panel Discussion with EECS Faculty and Staff (attached here please see biographies of panelists and questions to be posed by moderator)
4:35pm ET: Questions submitted through Slido application by attendees will be posed to panelists
4:55pm ET: Prof. Kolodziejski will briefly describe a few details of PhD program
5:00pm ET: Close of Webinar

Logistics:
1.  From now until noontime ET Monday, Nov. 28th, please submit any questions you wish for the panelists to address and offer your votes for the most important questions. Your questions can be submitted via this Slido link: https://app.sli.do/event/hGRvNgfNsP6YKUeuELgZuW
2.  Using the same link above, join the webinar conversation on Monday, Nov. 28th from 3:30-5pm ET.
3.  The discussion will be recorded live. Following the event, the video will be closed-captioned and added to the EECS YouTube channel. Information regarding how to access the recorded video will be forthcoming. The video will be available for viewing until December 16th, 2022.

We hope you will find the information regarding our department helpful as you consider if our PhD program meets your professional goals. We also hope the conversation about the doctoral graduate application process is valuable as you prepare your application to our program, and also to other PhD programs you are considering. We appreciate the stress and uncertainty associated with the application process; hopefully, we will add some clarity and helpful pieces of advice.

We wish you the very best as you continue your pursuit of your academic and career goals.

Sincerely, Professor Kolodziejski

A note to readers from Isaac
BY ISAAC SAUL – 23 NOV 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Dear reader,
Last year, around Thanksgiving, I wrote a post about gratitude and the power of giving thanks. I know it sounds a little "woo-woo" and corny, but it's true that expressing gratitude is good for your mental health and, well, just good for the world.
So let me quickly say thank you.
Right now, as I pen this newsletter, media outlets across the country are suffering.
Thousands of media jobs have been cut over the last few months, and many more will be in the near future. Warner Bros. and Disney are laying people off. CNN is restructuring. The company that owns CBS is trimming down, as is NBCUniversal. Protocol, an offshoot of POLITICO, just folded. Morning Brew, a business newsletter much bigger than Tangle, is laying off 14% of its employees. Vice is planning to cut its costs by 15%. Gannett, the company that owns USA Today, fired 400 people in August. Now it says more layoffs are coming.
These are just a few places, but they paint a good picture of what's happening in the media space right now. For my entire career, moments like this would lead to consternation, weeks of anxiety, lots of uncertainty, and — of course — the pressure to drive more traffic or revenue to a website with my journalism. I am thinking of and feeling for many of my former colleagues in the media world. Cycles like this are always brutal to live through.
But in the meantime, I'm also grateful. With Tangle, I have a steady stream of subscription revenue and a stable business model. I'm the boss, the one who gets to decide who or what gets cut, and — despite a slow couple months of growth — I have no plans except to keep investing in this little media company we are building. To be in that position is a privilege, and it’s not one I take for granted. It would not be possible without the people reading this email.
I'm also grateful for the next few days. In my family, Thanksgiving is the most important holiday of the year. So I'll be logging off for two days to spend some time with them and my childhood neighbors who we celebrate with every year. I recognize that many Americans spend the holidays working, alone, struggling to make ends meet, or all three. Please be considerate about this in the days ahead — and act accordingly. Be kind and generous. Show some love to your neighbors and to those in need (of friendship, financial support or a roof over their heads). In today's divided, angry and fractured environment, our country needs it more than ever.
With a few days off, I'd also like to encourage you to consider supporting Tangle. Of course, now is a great time to share Tangle, as I know the holidays (for many of you) can be contentious with family members whose politics you don't share. One of the most surprising pieces of feedback I've gotten about Tangle is hearing from so many people who say this newsletter has helped them discuss politics rationally with a parent, uncle, spouse, or other family member. I love that it can function that way, and encourage you to spread the word over the holiday break. And in that spirit, I have some easy tips to help navigate the holidays:
	•	Ask people about the experiences that inform their political views; experiences are almost always more personally compelling and formative than data.
	•	You’re not going to change anyone’s mind in one conversation, so don’t expect to. Just try to learn and say your piece.
	•	Try to listen more than you talk, and ask questions. The more you are asking, the more you’ll learn, and the better you’ll be able to communicate your argument when it’s your time to talk.
One way to support those conversations and get into the holiday spirit is to share this URL: www.readtangle.com/give
Every time someone signs up for our mailing list for free at www.readtangle.com/give, we will donate $1 to either No Kid Hungry or Meals On Wheels. Our idea is that we'd rather put money to a good cause than pay advertisers to push Tangle. If our readers do it for us, we can save the advertising money and donate it instead. Since we started, just 31 people (totaling $31) have signed up there, which has surprised me. My goal is to raise $1,000. Let's see what this community can do.
Less important, but no less noteworthy, is that we are also launching a three-day, 20%-off Black Friday deal for Tangle memberships. This deal will be good until Friday evening. Reminder: Being a paying subscriber unlocks Friday editions, grants access to 800+ posts in our archive, gets you special updates on our business plans, and opens up the comments section. It also helps us keep this project going. Subscriptions make up 95% of our revenue, pay my salary (and our staff’s) and allow us to invest in growing the newsletter. You can claim the deal here.
No matter what you do, I just want to reiterate my thanks. I am feeling incredibly grateful this holiday season for Tangle, for this community, and for the roof over my head.
We'll be back in your inbox on Monday, and I hope you can enjoy some downtime between now and then. As always, I encourage everyone to use these next couple of days to take a little break from the political happenings, too. It's always good for us.
All our best and Happy Thanksgiving,
Isaac & the Tangle team

Submitting Your Application
	•	The application is due by 5:00 p.m. EST on the deadline for your degree program of interest.

	•	The real meaning of Thanksgiving is the triumph of capitalism over the failure of collectivism in all its forms.
	•	Capitalism is driven by the law of supply and demand.
	•	Capitalism gives people the incentive to work hard. It encourages competition because individual performance is valued.

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES
1 Example is based on the average original monthly debt payment total vs. consolidated debt amount, and term received by actual customers who financed a debt consolidation with Discover Home Loans over the most recent three full months of available data. Payment reductions are for illustration purposes only and assume you make your home loan payment on time. Your actual payment reduction may vary depending on the APR and term of your home loan, the actual terms of your credit accounts, and how you make payments on those accounts. Taking cash out in addition to consolidating debt will increase your monthly payment. Your actual APR may be higher or lower than the APR shown here, which is based on APRs available as of the date of this communication and creditworthiness. Please visit Discover.com/home-loans/rates to see today’s APRs. 
2 Property Valuation is an estimate and is provided for informational and non-commercial purposes only. The valuation is based on available data provided by the AVM owner, who is an express third-party beneficiary of these terms of use and does not constitute an appraisal of the property and should not be relied upon in lieu of underwriting or an appraisal.
3 Your estimated available equity is based on 85% of the estimated value of your home minus the amount of any existing mortgages, home equity loans, or home equity lines of credit. When you apply, we will determine the actual amount you may be able to borrow based on a valuation of your property and other criteria.
This is not a commitment to lend; you must submit additional information for review. All loans are subject to credit and property approval. Not all applications will be approved. Rates, program terms and conditions are subject to change without notice. Products currently not available in IA and MD. States where loan products are offered are subject to change. Not all products are available in all states for all loan amounts. This offer is not valid on cooperatives, condotels, investment properties, manufactured homes, mobile homes or secondary homes.

Subject: Announcing 2023 Giving Tuesday Initiatives!

ECH Giving Tuesday 
Special Addition!
 
Skip the Gala and Go Straight to Breaking Cycles of Generational Poverty!
3 Giving Tuesday Initiatives: 
 
#1 Fund 3 Additional Self-Reliance Trainers:﻿
Trainers teach basic business principles to those who want to start a business and/or who already have a small business and want to increase production and income. 
 
On average, each Trainer teaches 2-4 concurrent classes w/30 participants, each running 3-4 months. Trainers also mentor Graduates and, with an 80% graduation rate, this keeps them very busy! 
 
ECH needs more Trainers to reach all who are waiting! 
 
Needed: $13,200 per trainer
 Lift hundreds from Poverty - Support a Self-Reliance Trainer!  
 
 
#2 Self-Reliance Kick Starts!
ECH partners with Municipalities to honor graduating participants, like Neilda, with needed materials to implement business plans. 
 
Example: Neilda can now support her family by sewing, utilizing the business strategies learned through ECH classes.  She could increase her business if she had a Serger. She is saving for this machine and ECH would like to reward her hard work by matching her savings to purchase one.
 
Needed: $4000 
This would secure various pieces of equipment. In turn, the graduates could purchase items such as sewing machines, ovens, freezers and so forth, directly from ECH.
 
 
 
#3 Increase Number of Children Sponsored:
Monthly Child Sponsorships provide safe havens for children to receive:
• Nutritious meals
• School supplies
•Tutoring 
All as a reward for school attendance. 
 
Rays of Hope, in Jesus Peru, currently sponsors 48 students and our goal is 60 children starting in 2023.
 
Example: Yosely Trigoso Caruajulca is 14 years old. She is one of the most special cases at Rays of Hope because Yoselyn suffers from leukemia. Her mother came to us asking for help because her Doctors said she needed a better diet. Her mother is very grateful for the food aid. Yosely has also joined the tutoring classes and is catching up on several subjects, like English, which she especially enjoys.
 
Semillas De Amor
Seeds of Love provides nutritious meals and tutoring for those who choose, for over 100 children. This center's food costs have sky-rocketed since CV. As a result they are closed on Fridays. With additional sponsorship Semillas could continue a 5 day nutrition and tutoring program for over 100 children. 
 
Needed: $3,600
Please consider a $15 a month child sponsorship or $180 for the year.  
($3,600 for 12 more children at Rays of Hope and sustaining Program at Semillas)
100% Goes to Your Designated Projects!

Once again, the Left doubled down and voted for open borders, but do you know what that looks like for the rest of America?
 
Every month, U.S. Border Patrol reports record-breaking illegal crossings. Destructive open border policies undermine United States sovereignty, violate federal law, and infringe on YOUR rights as a citizen.
 
The Left’s cruel and lawless open border policies have paved the way for unprecedented levels of drug and human trafficking, violent crime, and have had an unfathomable impact on American public health. 
 
Stream all six episodes of Border Battle NOW on SalemNow to learn how the border crisis will affect YOU for another two years.

We're breaking down the appoinment of another special counsel investigator to look into Trump. Plus, a question about who Democrats might try to run in 2024 (if not Biden).
From today's advertiser: It can be challenging to find unbiased news sources these days. There is one outlet I trust for everything from culture and science to sports and politics: 1440.

Reader feedback.
Here are two pieces of feedback I got to yesterday's newsletter on Nancy Pelosi:
"You are biased in your articles. Your editorials are totally biased but I guess since it is labeled 'editorial' you have a right to give your opinion. If so then do not call your newsletter unbiased. I guess you can tell I’m a Republican. Was really looking forward to reading 'just the news' but I’ll have to keep looking. It’s not easy with all the left wing media out there and you are just another one of many many upon many of them."
— Nancy
"This is one of my first newsletters, but I don't think I'll be sticking around. It's nice to know that you are just another 'non-partisan' guy who is actually a right-wing shill trying to make Democrats look like the bad guys any chance you get. Good luck with your project."

Today's topic. 
The new special counsel. On Friday, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel to oversee two Justice Department investigations into Donald Trump. Smith is a former federal and international war crimes prosecutor who once led the Justice Department unit that was responsible for public corruption cases.
He will be the third special counsel that has looked into Trump in the last five years, and will be responsible for leading the investigations into Trump's handling of the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago and the purported efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss. The appointment was made three days after Trump announced his plans to run for president.
Reminder: Special counsel investigators are a relatively new idea, first introduced in 1999 in an effort to hand over politically sensitive investigations to independent prosecutors. In 2016, special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Trump's potential collusion with Russian officials because the Justice Department believed it had a conflict of interest overseeing an investigation when many of its appointees were going to be nominated or tapped by the president-elect himself.
In Mueller's official report, he described Russia as engaged in disinformation and hacking campaigns to harm Democrats in the 2016 elections, and found contacts between Russia-linked entities and Trump campaign advisers, but did not discover any conspiracy between the two sides.  He did prosecute several senior Trump advisors for trying to curtail the investigation by lying to to investigators, and some for financial crimes, but Trump pardoned most of those advisors in his final days in office.
Before Trump left office, his handpicked Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham, another special counsel investigator, to look into the origins of Mueller's investigation into Trump and Russia. So far, both of Durham's criminal trials have ended in acquittals, and he is expected to release his final report in the near future. With Smith’s appointment, this is the first time in U.S. history that two special counsel investigations are active at the same time.
Special counsels still report to the attorney general and have to follow DOJ rules, but they create separation between the department and the investigation. It's a sign of the political sensitivity of the Trump investigations that Garland, who was nominated by President Biden to lead the DOJ, tapped Smith, a political independent, to lead the investigations.
“Based on recent developments, including the former president’s announcement that he’s a candidate for president in the next election, and the sitting president’s stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel,” Garland said in comments on Friday. “This appointment will not slow the completion of these investigations.”
Trump responded on Truth Social, his Twitter competitor.
“Here we go again!” he said, arguing that the Jan. 6 investigation was a “dead issue” and “likewise felt that the document hoax case…was dead, or at least dying fast. The Democrat Department of ‘Justice’ had nothing, except Trump haters, so they just appointed a Special Prosecutor to go after me further. Disgraceful!”
Even some allies of Biden and Garland were worried about the appointment of a special counsel, arguing that it might drag out any potential prosecution of Trump, while also making it seem as if the Justice Department is incapable of conducting its own independent investigations.
Today, we'll take a look at some reactions from the right and left to this news, then my take. You can find our previous coverage of the Mar-a-Lago search here, and our previous coverage of January 6 here.

What the right is saying.
	•	Many on the right criticize the special counsel appointment, saying it does not de-politicize the investigation.
	•	Some say it’s hypocrisy not to also have a special counsel in the investigation into Hunter Biden.
	•	Others suggest the special counsel may have been appointed to slow things down because Democrats want Trump to be a viable 2024 candidate.
In Spectator, Jed Babbin said the appointment is meant to prevent any prosecution from being labeled political, but that attempt will fail.
"Thanks to the repeal of the awful 'independent counsel' statute, any special prosecutor works for the attorney general and he, in turn, works for the president. Those facts render it inevitable that any prosecution of Trump, now a declared presidential candidate and likely opponent to Biden, is politically motivated unless proven otherwise," Babbin said. "Any trial of Trump would be held in Washington, D.C., because the conduct — destroying documents and the Jan. 6 speech — took place there. A D.C. jury would convict Trump of anything from the Lindbergh kidnapping to the death of George Floyd and no D.C. federal judge will order a change of venue because of that.
"This is the second time that Trump has been investigated by a special prosecutor. Robert Mueller’s investigation took two years and spent over $30 million trying to tie Trump and his 2016 campaign to Russia. Jack Smith’s investigation won’t take that long because it has a deadline, the next presidential election," he wrote. "The Smith investigation will aim to interfere with Trump’s campaign with selective leaks and may tie him up in a trial next year or even in 2024. Former Attorney General Bill Barr has said that the prosecutor probably already has enough evidence to indict Trump. Investigation and prosecution of political opponents are common in third-world despotisms but not in America. We deserve better and so does Trump."
Jonathan Turley called out the hypocrisy of Garland not appointing a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden.
"In making that case for a Trump special counsel, however, Garland may have made a case against himself for refusing to appoint a Biden special counsel in the Hunter Biden scandal. Garland’s department is investigating potential wrongdoing that could involve the other referenced candidate, President Biden, in the Hunter Biden matter," he said. "That investigation should be looking at numerous alleged references to the president using code names such as 'the Big Guy' in the context of receiving percentages on foreign deals and other perks. Yet Garland has refused to appoint a special counsel in an investigation that not only could prove highly embarrassing to the president but, in the view of some of us, could implicate him as well.
"House Republicans are now poised to look into these foreign deals — and how the Justice Department may have stymied or slowed any investigation before the 2020 election," Garland said. "While the special counsel appointment helps insulate Garland from claims about the use of his department for political purposes on any Trump charges, he may soon face new challenges, including possible contempt referrals if Biden officials or Democrats refuse to supply information or testimony to Republican House investigators. Garland has sharply departed from prior cases in which the Justice Department largely refused to prosecute such contempt referrals; he has been very active in pursuing Trump officials who failed to cooperate with Congress. He now may be asked to show the same willingness to pursue those who obstruct or defy House Republican investigations."
In National Review, Andrew McCarthy called it an "ironic" special counsel.
"The reason for appointing a special counsel is to create a layer of insulating independence, assuring the public that the conduct and outcome of a criminal probe are being driven by pure law-enforcement considerations, not by politics. Realistically, though, the special counsel provides no such assurance. In our constitutional system, the authority to prosecute is executive, so any federal prosecutor — special or ordinary — exercises power as a delegate of the president," he wrote. "There is no getting around the fact that Jack Smith, as he decides what to do about Donald Trump, will answer to the attorney general and to President Joe Biden, against whom Trump hopes to run in 2024. But the irony does not end there. Not by a long shot.
"We need a special counsel, lest the public believe the Democrats are using the government’s law-enforcement power to neutralize a threatening political opponent. In our almost-inconceivable situation, however, these are not the politics we’re dealing with. The Democrats want to run against Trump. The last thing they want is to neutralize him. They believe he can count on the subset of pro-Trump Republicans who adore him to vault him to the GOP nomination, thereby vanquishing Republican candidates who would pose more of a threat to Biden in the general election," McCarthy said. "At this point, with Trump, they are playing with house money: If he does not get charged, he is a political asset for Democrats in the 2024 campaign; if and when he is no longer a viable GOP candidate, he can be charged and anti-Trumpers everywhere will exult. Win-win."

What the left is saying. 
	•	Many on the left support the appointment, and call out Republicans for being impossible to please.
	•	Some argue Garland had no choice, and nothing he did would have persuaded Trump supporters he deserved to be investigated.
	•	Others say the special counsel will drag out the investigation and harm the Justice Department.
In The Los Angeles Times, Harry Litman said the right has "DOJ derangement syndrome."
"Almost as soon as Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland announced the appointment of a special counsel to provide independent, nonpartisan oversight of criminal investigations related to Donald Trump, Republicans started screaming," Litman said. "The appointment in itself, they said, demonstrated the Department of Justice’s corruption and politicization… Smith, a registered independent, is a career prosecutor who has honorably worked at the state, federal and international level. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has never been in the same room with Garland... Friday’s pile-on reveals that the GOP is working from an already formulated script that neither facts nor the law can change.
"For the rest of Joe Biden’s first term, the most orthodox or routine Justice Department decision will be flogged as a political scandal, with no regard for the specific merits of the cases. It’s just who Republicans are now: transparently politicizing and hyperpartisan actors. Their stance is not only deranged, it is fundamentally dishonest," he wrote. "These Republicans demonize Garland notwithstanding that any honest broker or Washington insider — including many of them — fully understands that Garland’s integrity, fair-mindedness and commitment to justice without fear or favor are beyond reproach, and that the investigations and potential prosecution of Trump is driven, indeed required, by a commitment to equal justice under law."
Ruth Marcus called it "cautious" but also "bold."
"I thought Garland had more leeway to make the judgment call the other way, but in retrospect it seems almost inevitable that the by-the-books attorney general would go the special counsel route," Marcus said. "Justice Department regulations provide that the attorney 'will appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted' and that investigation or prosecution 'would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances.' The regulations offer an out, one I previously wrote that Garland should take: The attorney general doesn’t have to name a special counsel if he decides that would not be in the public interest.
"But consider: An administration headed by a president who has announced his intention to seek reelection is investigating a former president who just declared he will run again. If this does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance, what would?" Marcus asked. "Naming a special counsel was never going to assuage the concerns of Trump partisans that the Biden administration is out to get him, as the immediate reaction from Trumpworld underscored. But Garland’s goal was not to persuade the unpersuadable. It was, in the familiar language of the law, aimed at how a reasonable person would perceive the fairness of the investigation, and whether a reasonable person would think a special counsel was warranted under the facts at hand and the language and spirit of the regulations."
In NBC News, Michael Conway criticized the appointment, saying it will bog the investigation down and contradict Garland.
"The stunning sweep of the mandate Garland conferred on special counsel Jack Smith likely doomed a prompt and focused determination of whether Trump should be indicted. Despite assurances from Garland that a special counsel will not bog down the investigation, reality suggests otherwise... the newly named special counsel will inherit the team of FBI agents and government prosecutors who have been conducting these investigations for months," Conway said. "If there were any taint of bias by these investigators — and there is none — then simply allowing the same Justice Department personnel to continue the investigation under a new boss wouldn’t cure any claimed conflict. Smith will simply be a new supervisor for the same investigators.
"Additionally, Garland’s comments implicitly acknowledged the perception that a standard by-the-book investigation of Trump by the Justice Department could be perceived as an appearance of a conflict of interest, which undermines his own oft-repeated statement that no one is above the law. Not to mention that past practice demonstrates that the Justice Department has regularly shown that anyone can be held accountable — without resorting to a special counsel... local federal prosecutors investigated Spiro Agnew while he was vice president for taking bribes when he was an official in Maryland... Former Republican Reps. Chris Collins of New York, Duncan Hunter of California and Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska were indicted by federal prosecutors and convicted... The fact that Trump is a former president or running for re-election makes no difference."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	Garland was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.
	•	We have a very clear need for an investigation into the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago.
	•	It is impossible for Garland to defend not appointing a special counsel in the Hunter Biden case. 
I'm not sure how much choice Garland really had.
He is a Biden appointee, and Biden says he is running for re-election, and Biden's chief political opponent says he is running for re-election too. There is a legitimate ongoing investigation into a legitimate issue of Biden’s chief political opponent, and not even trying to create separation there would be a huge problem. Is a special counsel a perfect solution? No. Does Jack Smith seem like a good choice? Yes. Will this calm the political waters at all? Almost certainly not.
Look: Based on Trump's own words, reporting, photo evidence released by the Justice Department, and a slew of other facts, we know that Trump took classified documents from the White House and stored them at Mar-a-Lago. We can say fairly confidently that he did not store them with much caution. We can easily imagine that they were "mishandled" in the legal sense. There are questions about why he did what he did, and if he destroyed any such documents, but those basic facts alone require an investigation.
As I've written before, comparisons to Hillary Clinton don't fit cleanly here. But obviously, Clinton not being charged will make it harder for Garland or Smith to justify prosecuting Trump now. They’ll need to demonstrate that Trump passed a clear threshold well above what Clinton did. Even if they do so successfully, though, the story of Clinton's email server broke in 2013. It has been a story for nine years since. She was investigated and cleared by the FBI and the Justice Department Inspector General. She was also investigated by numerous partisan congressional committees and the State Department. 
Those investigations took years. If we want to treat her and Trump "fairly" or "evenly," then he has to go under the microscope the same way she did.
The investigations into January 6 are much more difficult and, in my opinion, much more politically perilous. We are less sure what exactly Garland was looking for and what exactly he has. Trump's role on January 6 was both public and obvious but also squishy. Are they going to try to charge him for inciting a riot because of the rally he held in D.C.? Will they try to get him on obstructing the count of the electoral vote? Is there something that happened that we still don't know, even after the January 6 hearings? It's harder to parse. I think Trump's greatest legal threat will come from state-level investigations like the one in Georgia.
Regardless, it is also true that having this special counsel but not one for the investigation into Hunter (and Joe) Biden is mind-boggling. We know that investigators believe they have enough evidence to charge Hunter Biden with tax and gun crimes. We also know Biden's defense team is meeting with the Justice Department to counter the government's potential case. We know that the emails published from Hunter Biden's laptop were authentic, and show he tried to peddle his father's influence for foreign business deals — even floating the idea of potentially breaking off some profits for the now-president.
The idea that an investigation into the president's son, and potentially the president himself, does not require separation from the Justice Department, but an investigation into his political opponent does, is just as ridiculous as it reads.
Of course, the whole current state of affairs is frankly quite unprecedented if you pause to think about it. We now have two active federal investigations into the odds-on Republican presidential favorite for 2024. We have an active federal investigation into a previous federal investigation of that same candidate. We have an active federal investigation into the current president's son — one that may touch the president himself. And we have a new Republican House majority promising to launch at least five separate investigations into the President and several of his high ranking administration officials the moment they get control of Congress.
Are you keeping up?
As Jonathan Turley so eloquently put it, "There seemed to be enough torpedoes in the water in Washington this week that you could walk across the Potomac without getting your feet wet." 

Your questions, answered.
Q: Is there a Democratic candidate outside of Biden that can successfully challenge Trump?
— Matthew from Houston, Texas
Tangle: Sure. I think there are plenty who’d have a decent shot. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is loved by the Biden administration and seems adept at going on Fox News and talking to independent and right-leaning voters. He's probably the best communicator the party has had since Obama, even if he's loathed by progressives. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer just cleaned house in her election in a swing state. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has name recognition and executive experience in the most populous state in the union, however tattered its reputation.
I think there are other less well known folks who may become better known soon, too. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is an interesting prospect, though he's shown no sign he is going to run. I think Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown has real working class appeal (and can win in red states), but again: No indication he wants to step up. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet couldn't get any traction in 2020, but I wouldn't be shocked if he gave it another run in 2024 — and if voters gave him another long look. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis should be in the conversation, too.
Obviously, Vice President Kamala Harris will be on the map, though I don't think she could beat Trump. Even if she were anointed by Biden, her time in the spotlight has loaded her with too much baggage, and her role as vice president has been... underwhelming. Democrats’ best shot is probably to recruit someone lesser known, meaning Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders should probably step aside.
It's a long way off, but I'm keeping a close eye on a few governors across the country. It has been a while since we had a governor elected president (the last one was George W. Bush in 2000). But Congress is so poisoned in the public's eye that I think Democrats would be wise to look to some purple state executives for a Democratic replacement, if they seek one out.

Under the radar. 
For the first time in decades, it may be more economical to eat out for Thanksgiving than shop, cook and clean up for a traditional meal. That's according to a new Wells Fargo analysis that dives into the current state of food inflation. The combination of record food prices with turkey and cranberry shortages has a lot of Americans looking to restaurants to fill the gaps. Those restaurants, who are still trying to recoup pandemic losses, are happily welcoming them. It's a simple numbers game: The cost of dining out has gone up 5.8% over the last year, while the cost of groceries has risen 9.8%. Axios has the story.

Numbers.
	•	2%. The percentage of Americans who say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right "just about always."
	•	19%. The percentage of Americans who say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right "most of the time."
	•	45%. The percentage of Americans who say they believe Trump broke the law in his handling of classified documents or efforts to overturn the election.
	•	44%. The percentage of Americans who say they believe Trump did not break the law in his handling of classified documents or efforts to overturn the election
	•	17%. The percentage of Americans who say his storing of documents at Mar-a-Lago was not illegal but it was unethical.
	•	40%. The highest percentage of Americans that ever said Trump broke the law in regards to the Russia investigation.

Have a nice day.
A new report shows that South Korea is successfully recycling close to 100% of its food waste, a remarkable feat that experts think could be a model for the rest of the world. Using a combination of low-cost food composting bags, automated food waste collectors in apartments, and the spread of processing plants, South Korea went from recycling just 2.6% of its food waste in 1996 to nearly 100% today. In the U.S., food waste still winds up predominantly in landfills, where it releases methane into the air or pollutes waterways. As many as nine states now have bans on landfilling organic waste, and several cities are introducing experimental programs to try to implement food waste recycling on a broad scale. The Guardian has the story.

Hello Bryant, 

On this Thanksgiving day, I’d like you to read an excerpt from an essay that reminds me why I’m so grateful Scouting plays a part in so many lives. This essay was written by Julia Shepherd, one of the first female Eagle Scouts and first-place winner in the Central Florida Council scholarship contest. She said,

“Leaders have to make decisions, be problem solvers, face adversity, and follow their moral obligations – all principles of Scouting. … Teaching young girls and boys the values of responsibility, loyalty, leadership, and camaraderie at this age equips them for life in the reality we live in. In the ever-changing society that we are a part of, these characteristics are fundamental for children to possess and carry with them into adulthood.”

That’s true, isn’t it? Scouting builds up young people to mold them into better adults. It’s not just about today, but about tomorrow. Speaking of the future, Julia also eloquently wrote these words:

“The Scout stands for pride, integrity, opportunity, strength, freedom, and the true meaning of being an American, as they embody the flag on the uniform. Scouting instills these values into young Americans who will grow up with respect for their country, only building upon it as they age. … Scouts are our future, and they are equipped with a skillset that gives me confidence and faith in the future of our country.”

I couldn’t have said it better myself! Discover how Julia uses the components of her Scouts BSA uniform as a metaphor for Scout values—and read her entire essay, if you wish, at this link: https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2022/06/20/worth-reading-eagle-scouts-essay-on-the-importance-of-scouting-in-america/

I, for one, am thankful to live in a world with Eagle Scouts like you––and can only imagine the exceptional impact Julia and Scouts of future generations will have on our world.

Yours in Scouting, 
 
Frank Tsuru
National President

Hi Bryant— 
Thanksgiving is around the corner, and for most of us that means enough turkey to make you burst, enough drink to make your head hurt, or enough family to last another year! 
So if you simply cannot swallow another piece of dry turkey, Grandpa's had too much to drink again, or you're stuck in the corner with that family member, here's your excuse to slip away for 15 minutes... 
You see, our community just cannot wait until after Thanksgiving to hear about the software in our list...and if you review anything in there, we'll send you a $10 Amazon gift card to say thanks!

Happy Thanksgiving!

HIGHS AND LOWS
 
  
I highly encourage you to watch my highs and lows video below. I went on one of my favorite runs this week, super early in the morning, as I am still on overseas time from my trip to Egypt for the United Nations Climate Summit. On the run, I had a great view of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and Capitol. It was a great start to one of my mornings. 
 
Well, my high for this week is clearly reaching the 218 mark that was needed for Republicans to take back the majority in the House. Very significant. And in a video later on in this newsletter, I will share why it's so significant, how that's going to influence me, and my goals for next year. One aspect I will go into is a government that is mandated to work across the aisle. 
 
And my low is well, we have a very thin margin in the majority so keep scrolling for that video. 
 
Hope everyone has a great weekend. 
  
 
  
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 
  
With Congress in session this week, I was with Sophie, who many of you know if you are traveling to D.C. and found something that paints a different view of our nation’s capital.  
  
 
  
 
GET REAL WITH JOHN
 
  
There has been a lot of discussion about what a small Republican majority means in the House of Representatives and I want to have this kind of frank conversation about one of the aspects that's going to be very relevant over the next two years. 
  
 
 
 
  
 
ABC NEWS: REPUBLICANS PREVIEW 'RATIONAL ENVIRONMENTALISM' APPROACH TO CLIMATE POLICY IF THEY TAKE CONTROL OF HOUSE
 
  
House Republicans previewed how their party would approach climate and energy policy if they win the majority in the House of Representatives at an event at the United Nations' climate summit known as COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this week.

Hey Snackers,
Just in time for cuffing szn: people can snuggle with a human-sized emotional-support plushy. It has the body of a man and the head of a bear. Slightly terrifying, but at least it doesn’t snore.
Stocks fell last week after optimism about cooling inflation was tempered by suggestions from central-bank officials that rate hikes may need to stay aggressive. The techy Nasdaq shed 1.5% for the week as hopes of a Fed slowdown dwindled.

SNEEZE
FTX “contagion” spreads, highlighting the crypto industry's interdependence
One-two contagion punch… As the crypto industry reels from FTX's collapse, the billion-dollar question is, who might be next? We may know soon, as BlockFi's reportedly planning to file for bankruptcy. The crypto lender, which held nearly $4B in customer assets, paused withdrawals this month, citing "significant exposure to FTX." It also had loans out to Alameda Research, FTX's so-called sister firm. It's not the first time contagion’s come for BlockFi:
	•	Terra-part: The TerraUSD stablecoin melted down in May, wiping out $40B in investor value. The resulting chaos felled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which in turn threatened BlockFi, which had made loans to 3AC.
	•	FTXtra Life: BlockFi was saved partly by a $400M credit line from FTX. Now FTX might be its undoing.
FTX's bankruptcy is a powerful blow… because crypto is a highly leveraged industry (think: using borrowed assets to make trades). That causes ripple effects when big players fall. Liquid, an exchange that FTX acquired this year, froze withdrawals last week. Crypto lender Genesis suspended new loans and redemptions. Gemini, the Winklevoss-helmed exchange that used Genesis to offer a yield product, also paused some redemptions. Retail exchange Genesis Block said on Friday that it would cease trading. And there's fear contagion could spread even further:
	•	Crypto.com (picture: Matt Damon Super Bowl ads, Lakers’ stadium-naming rights) tried to reassure investors it would not follow FTX.
	•	Nine exchanges now say they'll offer up "proof of reserves" to show they still have customers' assets.
 
THE TAKEAWAY
Contagion thrives because crypto's interwoven… with leverage as the thread. If a crypto lender or exchange lends its customers' assets to a hedge fund (like: 3AC or Alameda), which then uses those assets to generate yield (aka: earn crypto interest) and make potentially risky bets… one wobbly domino risks toppling the whole lot. FTX’s bankruptcy isn’t the end of this story: Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao says he’s "very worried" about some forms of crypto leverage — and regulators are on high alert.

EVENTS...
Coming up this week
“Power casual” Lulu fit… Workers are slowly returning to offices, and there’s less room for Zoom. While office occupancy is still lower than prepandemic, 88% of employers are offering workers incentives to return IRL. The number of workers returning to cubicles is rising, and 9 in 10 companies surveyed said they planned to require workers in offices (at least part time) by 2023. That hurts pandemic powerhouses like Zoom, which reports today. Last quarter it cut its sales forecast as growth majorly slowed from the pandemic Zoom boom.
Forks up, sweatpants on… wallets out. Thanksgiving is on Thursday, but grocery prices are already eating into budgets. A third of Americans plan to spend less on their feasts this year, with the average meal for 10 hitting $64, up 20% from last year. Turkey is up 21% while stuffing mix has soared 70%. Some retail giants are gaining customers by keeping prices (relatively) low: Walmart says it’s keeping Thanksgiving meal prices the same as last year, and more higher-income shoppers turned to the retailer last quarter for discounts.

ZOOM OUT
Stories we’re watching...
Ready for flu szn… As Americans look for easily accessible healthcare, retailers are racing into the industry. Last week Amazon launched its first virtual healthcare clinic to treat patients for everything from allergies to acne. Amazon also agreed to buy clinic chain One Medical in July. Last year, Walgreens took a $5B stake in VillageMD and is now opening an average of one clinic every three days. Meanwhile, CVS has grown its HealthHUBs, where shoppers can meet with medical pros in stores. Retailers could help capture 30% of the primary-care market by 2030.
Credit cards are red hot… because swiping is soaring. Card balances rose 15% last quarter from last year — the fastest jump in two decades — as cash-strapped shoppers leaned on plastic for inflated expenses. But as the Fed hikes rates, IOUs have gotten pricier: some cards have interest rates of 30%+ (translation: a $1K purse would cost $700+ in annual interest if you didn’t pay off the full balance on time). With 60% of Americans now living paycheck to paycheck, historically low delinquency rates are starting to rise.

ICYMI
Last week's highlights...
	•	Swift: T-Swift’s world tour crashed Ticketmaster as millions of fans (and resellers) rushed to the Live Nation-owned platform. Swifties may have bad blood, but Live Nation’s music dominance makes it hard to escape.
	•	Hunt: As more shoppers “treasure hunt” for bargains, discount retailers like Marshalls owner TJX and Ross are humming along — while mid-tier (not discount, not luxe) chains like Target and Kohl’s suffer.
	•	3BR: As wild mortgage rates and prices depress home-buying demand, JPMorgan said it’ll build $1B worth of single-family homes for renters. With mortgage revenue down, JPM hopes to capitalize on the “rent-aissance.”

What else we're Snackin'
	•	Blood: Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison on Friday for defrauding investors through her blood-testing startup. Holmes had faced up to 20 years after being found guilty in January.
	•	RT: As many as 1.2K Twitter employees may’ve resigned after Elon Musk sent staff an ultimatum to work “long hours at high intensity” or quit (with severance). Some are concerned about Twitter’s operational ability after a layoff halved its workforce.
	•	Awk: Days before the World Cup kicked off yesterday, host country Qatar banned sales of alcohol at and around its stadiums, an awkward situation for the tourney’s official beer sponsor, Budweiser.

This week’s pro tip:
Don’t discount your previous experiences.
You may think some of your college or work experiences aren’t relevant, but if you held a summer job, helped with a campus organization, or worked with a study group, that can show recruiters you gained transferable skills (AKA skills that can be used in an internship or full-time role).

HIGHS AND LOWS
 
  
I highly encourage you to watch my highs and lows video below. I went on one of my favorite runs this week, super early in the morning, as I am still on overseas time from my trip to Egypt for the United Nations Climate Summit. On the run, I had a great view of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and Capitol. It was a great start to one of my mornings. 
 
Well, my high for this week is clearly reaching the 218 mark that was needed for Republicans to take back the majority in the House. Very significant. And in a video later on in this newsletter, I will share why it's so significant, how that's going to influence me, and my goals for next year. One aspect I will go into is a government that is mandated to work across the aisle. 
 
And my low is well, we have a very thin margin in the majority so keep scrolling for that video. 
 
Hope everyone has a great weekend. 
  
 
  
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 
  
With Congress in session this week, I was with Sophie, who many of you know if you are traveling to D.C. and found something that paints a different view of our nation’s capital.  
  
 
  
 
GET REAL WITH JOHN
 
  
There has been a lot of discussion about what a small Republican majority means in the House of Representatives and I want to have this kind of frank conversation about one of the aspects that's going to be very relevant over the next two years. 
  
 
 
 
  
 
ABC NEWS: REPUBLICANS PREVIEW 'RATIONAL ENVIRONMENTALISM' APPROACH TO CLIMATE POLICY IF THEY TAKE CONTROL OF HOUSE
 
  
House Republicans previewed how their party would approach climate and energy policy if they win the majority in the House of Representatives at an event at the United Nations' climate summit known as COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this week.

Subject: iSchool Faculty Driven By The Pursuit of Justice
Date: November 19, 2022 at 10:12:40 AM MST
To: bryant0918@gmail.com
Reply-To: igrad@syr.edu

    
Hey Bryant,
One reason that makes the iSchool great is our team of world-class faculty and teachers.
(So, make that 40+ reasons.)
It’s true — our students love showing up to engaging lectures and hands on labs with some of the most renowned professors in the field of information science.
That’s because we don’t just teach you how to use the latest tools and software. We teach you how to make a difference and do work that matters.
Today we want to introduce you to Dr. Jasmina Tacheva, a recent Assistant Professor at the iSchool.
“Before coming to the iSchool, I felt torn between my love of coding and my sense of justice,” Jasmina said. “When I found the iSchool, it was a liberating experience.”
She says the iSchool’s focus on greater social issues — not just software and data — is what makes it stand out above other programs.
At its core, Jasmina’s research investigates what motivates people to do good even in the face of adversity.
Why do people tweet pictures of stranded pets during a hurricane, for example?
How do online phenomena like customer reviews facilitate community support systems?
And in the time of COVID-19, how does social media impact whether university students and staff will actually wear masks?
While the research Jasmina and other professors do at the iSchool is unique in itself, it’s the community of faculty, students, and staff that really makes it special.
“If this is how tight-knit and caring the iSchool is like in times of crisis, I can’t wait to see how it will be when things start to normalize.”
Will you be there to join us? If you'd like to connect with our admissions team, faculty and current students, explore our virtual visit opportunities.
Sincerely,

Zachary Schuster Director for Graduate Admissions and Recruitment School of Information Studies  igrad@syr.edu
P.S. We’re always available for a 1-on-1 meeting to answer your questions and explore the right options for you. Make an appointment today!

Subject: How Do I Find Confidence to Stand Firm When My Faith Is Challenged or Mocked?
Date: November 17, 2022 at 3:07:32 PM MST
To: bryant0918@gmail.com
Reply-To: emailreply@ChurchofJesusChrist.org

Elder Bednar discussed 10 spiritually essential truths and invites each of us to "awake and arouse [our] faculties" and to "exercise a particle of faith." 
 
How Do I Find Confidence to Stand Firm When My Faith Is Challenged or Mocked?

How Do I Find Confidence to Stand Firm in My Beliefs When My Faith Is Challenged or Mocked? 
 
There are countless scriptural accounts of people criticizing the faith of followers of Jesus Christ. Korihor stated to Alma, "Ye cannot know of things which ye do not see," and he described the believers of Christ as having "frenzied" and deranged minds (Alma 30:15–16). 
 
Does this sound familiar? Many of us know individuals, often those we are close to and care about, who have questioned or been critical of the Church, its doctrine, and its practices. At times, we may be the ones with questions and doubts. 
 
You Can Find Answers and Confidence 
In a recent two-part devotional to young adults, Elder David A. Bednar shared: 
 
"If all you know about the gospel of Jesus Christ is what others have told you, then you will never know enough. If all you know is what you have read in books written by others, you will never know enough. An individual price must be paid to learn for yourselves. You cannot live on borrowed light." 
 
"Immerse yourself in the scriptures, and ask, seek, and knock. You need to have an individual knowledge of these eternal truths. The covenants into which you enter are personal and specific. They are administered one by one. Each of us needs and can have an individual and personal covenant connection with the resurrected and living Lord Jesus Christ." 
 
Elder Bednar discussed 10 doctrinal truths that have been restored and clarified in this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph Smith and taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 
	1.	The nature and character of the Godhead
	2.	Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation
	3.	The importance of mortality and a physical body 
	4.	The Creation of the earth and the Fall of Adam and Eve
	5.	The Atonement of Jesus Christ
	6.	Priesthood authority and keys 
	7.	Prophets, apostles, and revelation 
	8.	Additional latter-day scripture 
	9.	Covenants and ordinances 
	10.	Temple covenants and ordinances and vicarious work for the dead 
 
An Invitation and a Promise
Elder Bednar invites each of us to gain our own testimonies of these fundamental points of doctrine through the power of the Holy Ghost—that our asking, seeking, and knocking continue with increased focus, sincere hearts, and real intent. 
 
Read Devotional—Part 1 
 
Read Devotional—Part 2
 
 
 
 
 
"Reason is important and useful; however, it is neither the best nor the only way of knowing. A witness of truth by the power of the Holy Ghost that we invite into our soul produces a spiritual knowledge, an illumination, and a conviction more sure, more powerful, and more enduring than can be received through seeing, hearing, touching, or rational argument alone."
- Elder David A. Bednar

100 FREE SPEECH VICTORIES! 
 
That’s right, Young Americans for Liberty and students like you brought the heat and reached this milestone. That’s 100 anti-free speech policies overturned and replaced with constitutionally sound policies that protect student rights. 

Boise State University was restricting students’ freedom of speech backhandedly, through a policy that should have only dealt with salesmen, not student activists. The fight with BSU lasted over three years, but it paid off. Boise State changed its student handbook to remove EVEN MORE restrictions on free speech. 
 
Each year, over 1.5 MILLION students’ rights are protected through YAL’s Student Rights Campaign.
 

If you know of any bad campus policies, or are being silenced by your campus, send reports to yaliberty.org/src or contact the Student Rights Team directly at src@yaliberty.org.

Subject: HUGE book sale this weekend!
Date: November 17, 2022 at 10:53:27 AM MST
To: bryant0918@gmail.com

 
 
It's our biggest book sale in the biggest room we have! Join us in the ballroom to browse thousands of books, movies, magazines, and more. 
 
BALLROOM BOOK SALE
Friday, November 18 | 3:00 - 6:00 PM
Saturday, November 19 | 12:00 - 4:00 PM
Ballroom
 
All books are $1; this sale will also include A/V materials, magazines, and board games (prices as marked, though most are $5 or less).   
 
QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Q: Where do all these books come from?
A: Books sold at the book sale are either discards from our collection that we no longer need (either because they are damaged or not checking out at a rate that justifies their stay on our shelves) or donations that we don't feel we need to add to our collection.   This does mean that the book condition varies: you can find some brand-new gems, and also some books that have been...pre-loved. All books are sold as-is, with no discounts for damage. 
 
Q: What forms of payment do you accept? 
A: We accept cash, check, or credit card. We do NOT accept ApplePay, PayPal, or Venmo.
 
Q: What do you do with the money you earn?
A: Library book sales fund library programs, so if you've enjoyed meeting authors or learning how to fix your bicycle, library book sales are partly to thank. 
 
Q: Last time I went to the book sale it seemed a little disorganized; can you sort the books more before you put them out for sale?
A: The books are organized VERY generally: children's books, adult/young adult fiction, and adult/young adult nonfiction. We like to think you're getting a two-for-one deal: a cheap book AND a treasure hunt! In all seriousness, part of the reason that we can afford to charge you only $1 is that we don't devote staff time to sorting, organizing, and pricing all the books. The time we save in setting up the book sale is a savings that we pass along to you. 
 
Q: Do you have a list of everything that will be for sale?
A: See above answer; this is perhaps a thing we could do if we had a large sorting space, staff for just this task, and a catalog for keeping track of our inventory, but what we've just described is a book store, and we are a library. If you enjoy paying $1 instead of $15-$30, enjoy the hunt! 
 
Q: Darn and blast! I have plans for this weekend and can't attend! Will you do this in the future?
A: Feel free to browse our Used Book Store any time, but we will absolutely do another big book sale. We do them roughly every 4 months, so look for another big book sale in March 2023. 
 
Q: What do you do with the books you don't sell? 
A: We pack them up and then bring them out again at another sale! Our experience is that almost everything goes eventually. And when it doesn't...well, if you've seen us at a farmer's market with a box of free books (mostly mass market paperbacks), that's where they eventually end up! 
 
Q: Do you do any discounts for teachers or resellers? 
A: We enthusiastically support your cause, but we do not do any kind of discounts based on your profession or the number of items you buy. We feel like $1 per book is already a hefty discount. 
 
Q: I've heard that at a certain time you do actually offer discounts; when does that happen, and what are the discounts?
A: It is true that as our book sale is coming to a close and we are faced with the task of carting the books back into storage for another sale, we do occasionally decide to incentivize clearing out as many books as possible. However, sometimes we don't feel it's necessary. Discounts are announced willy-nilly based on our own capricious natures, and that's truly the best answer we can give. Sometimes we'll do a deal (a box or a bag for a certain price), but not always, and especially not if we feel like people are hoarding books and hanging around hoping for a deal. Is that inconsistent? Yes, wildly. But we like it like that.

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 14 minutes.
🚨
We're going long on Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX, the complicated story of a Democratic mega donor and cryptocurrency exchange going belly up. Plus, a reader question about the alleged "15,000" Iranians being sentenced to death, a preview of tomorrow, and a chance to advertise in Tangle. 
From today's advertiser: It can be challenging to find unbiased news sources these days. There is one outlet I trust for everything from culture and science to sports and politics: 1440. It's one of the first things I read every morning. The team of PhDs and industry experts at 1440 scour over 100 news sources to create one daily email that gets you caught up on the day’s events in just five minutes. It’s independent and 100% free; sign up for 1440 here.

Advertise with us!
Heading into Q1 of 2023, we are looking to line up a slate of advertisers for our free newsletter. As I explained in my announcement on why we're using ads, my goal is to create a diverse revenue stream that insulates us from financial stress, which would allow us to continue to report independently, compete with other news outlets, and build out the Tangle team.
Outside of financials, though, my biggest hope is that our partners come from people (like you reading this) in the Tangle community. So if you are interested in reaching a highly engaged, intelligent audience of over 50,000 people, please fill out this form to get linked up with our team. Thank you!

Tomorrow: Midterm postmortem.
In tomorrow's subscribers-only edition, we'll be breaking down the leading theories about why the midterm went the way it did, with evidence for each argument. If you're interested in getting a more fleshed out, deep-dive look at the results, this edition is for you. Keep an eye out for it in your inbox and don't forget to share it when it comes through!
P.S. Don't forget that you are on our free mailing list. This means you get Monday-Thursday emails for as long as you want (we try to keep 80% of our content free). However, Friday editions are for paying members, who also get ad-free versions of the newsletter, access to the comment section, and more. You can become a Tangle member and support our work by clicking here.

Today's topic.
FTX bankruptcy and Sam Bankman-Fried (also known as SBF). Over the last few days, dozens of emails have come into Tangle requesting that we cover this story. It has a lot of elements: Finance, politics, Ukraine, cryptocurrency and more. We've waited because there was not much clarity early on about what exactly happened, but a picture is starting to emerge. Today, we're going to try to do the basics: Explain what happened, why it matters to you, why it’s relevant to a politics newsletter, and what people are saying about it.
What happened: On Friday, FTX (the company’s full name, and an abbreviation for “Futures Exchange”), the third largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, filed for bankruptcy. A crypto exchange is a place where people can trade digital currencies or crypto for other assets like conventional money. The company filed for bankruptcy after experiencing the crypto version of a "bank run," an event that happens when fears that a bank may cease to exist cause so many customers to try to withdraw their funds simultaneously that the bank can't dole out all the cash.
Bankman-Fried, who is a Democratic mega donor and was recently estimated to be worth $23 billion, stepped down as CEO. His net worth has all but evaporated and an estimated one million FTX customers are now having trouble withdrawing their cash, and may continue having trouble for a long time.
Why does it matter: Crypto is an emerging space that politicians already have their eyes on, and the circumstances of FTX's downfall have prompted lawmakers and lobbyists to call for more regulation and oversight. FTX wasn't just short enough liquid assets to cover its liabilities, it also appears to have created a web of other crypto currencies to inflate just how much coverage it really had. Fears about similar exchanges crumbling have led to crypto markets falling $150 billion last week alone.
Through FTX and other companies, Bankman-Fried has significant investment and stakes in many companies across the crypto space. But FTX was also not just limited to the crypto space. FTX and Bankman-Fried's money cast a huge net. He was the second largest Democratic donor in the world behind only George Soros. He donated nearly $38 million in this midterm cycle alone, and he also helped run a website to allow people to donate cryptocurrency to Ukraine. It had investments in major sports brands, too, including MLB, NBA and Formula One.
To give you an idea of just how wide a net this financing cast, consider this (which also doubles as a journalistic disclosure): FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried are investors in Semafor, a newly launched media start-up run by former BuzzFeed editor-in-chief and New York Times columnist Ben Smith. Semafor inquired about acquiring or partnering with Tangle, and I met with Smith to discuss the idea — but no deals came to fruition. So even I was briefly grazed by the cash Bankman-Fried and FTX were spreading around.
Now, Bankman-Fried and FTX are being investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if any criminal offenses were committed, according to the Associated Press.
The details: This story is incredibly complex, but generally speaking, it goes something like this: Bankman-Fried created FTX, a place where people can buy and sell crypto in exchange for other assets. He launched FTX with the profits he made from running a crypto hedge fund called Alameda Research, which built its fortunes buying crypto in one exchange and selling at a higher price in others. However, the two companies were supposed to be operating separately.
Two weeks ago, CoinDesk, a website that reports on the crypto space, dropped an article detailing the seemingly close ties between FTX and Alameda Research. Alameda's balance sheet consisted largely of tokens created by FTX. That realization caused a massive sell-off in those tokens over customer fears that something was amiss.
Subsequent reporting paints an even more troubling picture. It appears that when customers were buying and selling cryptocurrency on FTX, the company was preserving the value of their customer's money with liability assets that it mostly invented. Namely, other cryptocurrencies, which were being propped up in a cycle of convincing people the currencies were worth more than they were, inflating their market caps, and covering up the fact that FTX had very little actual liquid cash to support its customers (which is a very bad thing, especially if a crypto bank run happens).
One popular theory, explained neatly by Matt Levine, whose coverage of this story in Bloomberg has been essential, is that Bankman-Fried was passing money from FTX to Alameda — who then lost the money. Or that Alameda lost the money when crypto markets melted down earlier this year, and Bankman-Fried floated Alameda with FTX customer's cash, and then Alameda failed to make the money back. Either way, the same assets were appearing on both Alameda and FTX's balance sheets, and Reuters reported that Bankman-Fried was secretly using $10 billion of customer funds to prop up his trading business.
What we also know, for now, is that about $16 billion of customer cash went into FTX and nobody seems to know exactly where all that money is. Reuters reported that Bankman-Fried transferred $10 billion of customer cash from FTX to Alameda and a "large portion" has since disappeared. On Twitter, Bankman-Fried is now shopping around FTX's balance sheet in hopes of finding an investor to make his customers whole.
The story is having a massive impact in the crypto and finance space because of its effect on confidence in cryptocurrency generally. In politics, it has people talking about how Democrats will replace one of their biggest donors, and how Congress should be regulating the industry. In the philanthropy space, it's a bombshell: Bankman-Fried had promised to give away much of his massive wealth, and had donated to countless nonprofits — or assured them that money was coming.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions from the right and left, then my take. Given our specialty is politics, we'll focus on the political threads of this story.

What the right is saying. 
	•	Many say it's another warning sign about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, but are skeptical of government regulation.
	•	Some call out Democrats and the media, who had taken SBF's money and framed him as a rich do-gooder.
	•	Others say there are a lot of questions remaining about Democrats’ ties to SBF.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board called it "another lesson in the risk of joining a mania in speculative assets."
“According to a Journal report, FTX lent more than half of its customer assets to Alameda to fund risky bets. Uh oh. Mr. Bankman-Fried says FTX now faces a shortfall of up to $8 billion. If it can’t raise that cash, the plunge could be swift and the losses for investors steep, if not total. That’s capitalism, or at least a speculative form of it. Regulators will have to watch for contagion to the banking system, but there’s no reason not to let FTX fail if it comes to that. The last thing we need is the feds rescuing investors in speculative assets," the board said. "All of this is a lesson for crypto investors and the Fed, which encouraged excessive risk-taking by keeping real interest rates below zero for so long."
“Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has raised fair concerns about crypto company conflicts of interest and opaque profit-making activities such as those that seem to have landed FTX in trouble,” the board said. “But his regulation by enforcement isn’t working and merely fuels market uncertainty. Mr. Bankman-Fried and other crypto leaders have lobbied Congress to enact clear rules. Members of Congress disagree over which regulator is best suited to supervise crypto firms, but this can be worked out. The bigger problem is that progressives favor letting Mr. Gensler regulate the industry out of business. One worry is that an FTX collapse will become an excuse for him to do so.”
In The New York Post, Miranda Devine criticized the money made from nothing that arrived for Democrats at just the right time.
“It is a stunning fall to earth,” Devine said. “The financial media and big investors have feted the young billionaire as a saint who shunned earthly pleasures like Lamborghinis and Rolexes, but lived only to give away all his money and make the world a better place. He was the most famous millennial adherent of a cult known as ‘Effective Altruism,’ which originated at Oxford University, found fertile ground in Silicon Valley — and now has gone down in flames along with him. EA is a disguised form of socialism, because all the ‘good’ that is done just happens to match up perfectly with the left’s obsessions, whether climate change, social justice, equity, banning meat or his favorite, ‘pandemic preparedness.’
“SBF certainly ‘impacted’ the midterms, funneling his millions into the Democratic National Committee and Democrat-friendly PACs such as Protect Our Future and Guarding Against Pandemics. He donated to committees aligned with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to help Democrats win races,” she wrote. “He lavished his largesse on ‘pro-crypto Democrats’ like New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who was sponsoring a bill to lock the Securities and Exchange Commission out of regulating the crypto market.  He also visited the White House, meeting with top Biden adviser Steve Ricchetti on April 22 and May 12, according to the Washington Free Beacon. No wonder the Biden administration has been weak on regulating the crypto market. It was the goose that laid the golden egg. Meanwhile, the media massaged his profile.”
In The Epoch Times, Jeffrey Tucker described it as something akin to a Democratic money laundering scheme.
"Where to begin?" Tucker asked. "There is the strange relationship that FTX had with the Ukrainian government, which used the exchange as a depository of funds. This was well enough known that Bankman-Fried bragged about it. Then FTX became a huge donor to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Fascinating. Very convenient. This Ukrainian/FTX/DNC relationship would normally be all over the headlines as worthy of a deep look, especially with the midterm timing, the wild passion of the Biden administration to funnel as much money as it could to Ukraine at a time when Americans are suffering from high inflation, and the murky world of crypto financing that bypasses normal banking channels.
“There are other strange signs, such as how FTX was founded just following the announcement in 2019 that Biden would run for president and that Bankman-Fried’s own mother was a co-founder of Mind the Gap PAC, the sole purpose of which has been to fund Democrat campaigns,” Tucker said. “Additionally, there’s Alameda Research, which served as the investment arm and eventual destination of billions in customer funds from FTX, a practice that violated every best practice of the crypto world, which favors 100 percent reserves... It’s all just incredibly shocking: the ties, the trickery, the scamming, the dark money, the ruling-class ties, the fake organizations, the ridiculous celebration of who in retrospect is an obvious fraud, along with the silly children the fake man had tapped to pretend to be the C-suite of FTX’s sister company. What a symbol of our times.”

What the left is saying.
	•	Many liberals are disappointed in the news because they had high hopes for SBF's philanthropy.
	•	Others argue that this is the latest example of why we need regulation in the crypto space.
	•	Some express deep disappointment, saying SBF showed his true colors.
Matty Yglesias wrote about how much hope he had in SBF, and how bad the situation now looks.
"Bankman-Fried’s publicly stated plan was reckless. But the truth appears to be much worse than reckless, even as it’s still not fully clear exactly how much worse (did he and his circle lose the money? did they pocket it?), and for those of us who defended him against some of his critics, a reckoning is due. SBF is notable in politics because he gave a lot of money. He’s notable to me in particular because he gave to causes that I think are good," Yglesias said. "He gave tens of millions of dollars to get Donald Trump out of the White House (and also quite a bit to Democrats in the 2022 cycle)...”
“Any political success is a highly collective endeavor and no one person is responsible for any result. But money does matter in politics, and some of these races — including very notably the 2020 electoral college — were very close. It’s plausible that without SBF’s money, Trump would still be in the White House," Yglesias said. "By betraying his clients — I don’t know whether he 'defrauded' or whatever else in a legal sense, but he certainly betrayed them — SBF is leaving many of his causes worse off than they would have been if he’d never invested in them. He’s also brought negative brand energy to the whole concept of Effective Altruism, including the people working in areas he didn't spend as much of his money on, like farm animal welfare and public health in poor countries."
In The New Republic, Alex Shephard said he hopes it is a wake-up call for Democrats.
"It’s easy to imagine a world in which Sam Bankman-Fried treated this moment as a coronation, arriving as a new political power player who would use his vast wealth and influence for decades. Instead, as Democrats piled up victories in tight congressional elections, Bankman-Fried was holed up in the Bahamas as his cryptocurrency exchange collapsed amid a liquidity crisis and allegations that he had misused funds," Shephard wrote. "Democratic hopes in Bankman-Fried had already started evaporating before the elections. Although he spent big in the primaries, the spigot dried up down the stretch, possibly due to FTX’s worsening situation. By mid-October, he had backtracked on his '$1 billion' pledge, calling it 'dumb,' and paused campaign spending altogether.
"There is a lesson here for Democrats: Get out of bed with crypto bros like Bankman-Fried and regulate the industry," Shephard said. "For most of the last few years, the party has been divided on the rise of cryptocurrency, which is decentralized, unregulated digital currency. [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren, in particular, has pushed for more regulation, citing its potential for risk, fraud, and chaos, as well as its extreme environmental impact and the high energy required to 'mine' digital coins. Others in the party, meanwhile, have insisted that Democrats should proceed more gingerly. Bankman-Fried was intimately connected with many Democrats via campaign contribution... But Democrats have an opportunity not just to act but to unite on cryptocurrency regulations now—to stop taking money from the Bankman-Frieds of the world and to start pushing for badly needed regulations."
In Vox, Kelsey Piper recapped an interview she had with him this week, and expressed dismay at the positions he took.
"As we messaged, I was trying to make sense of what, behind the PR and the charitable donations and the lobbying, Bankman-Fried actually believes about what’s right and what’s wrong — and especially the ethics of what he did and the industry he worked in," she wrote. "Looming over our whole conversation was the fact that people who trusted him have lost their savings, and that he’s done incalculable damage to everything he proclaimed only a few weeks ago to care about. The grief and pain he has caused is immense, and I came away from our conversation appalled by much of what he said. But if these mistakes haunted him, he largely didn’t show it.
"Before his empire collapsed, Bankman-Fried was actively engaged in lobbying in Washington for a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency," she said. "But in our conversation, he dismissed their role. He characterized his past conciliatory statements — like when he said just last month that some amount of crypto regulation would be 'definitively good' — as little more than 'PR.' In doing so, he all but confirmed the view of critics who have argued that his overtures to Washington were much more about image than substance... Bankman-Fried has maintained that FTX has never invested the deposits of crypto account holders on the exchange. I pressed him on that point via Twitter, and while he continued to insist that FTX did not directly use account money in this way, he said that Alameda — which he also owns — had borrowed far more money from FTX’s balance sheet for investments than he had realized."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	I'm glad I was not caught in his massive net.
	•	It's supremely disappointing, because the crypto space has such potential.
	•	It's another reminder (to me) of the importance of these regulators, even though I sometimes despise the government.
I'm glad to be an observer in this mess — and not directly involved.
One of the fears I've always had about taking investment in Tangle, or being owned by someone, is that a situation like this could arise. Every mission-oriented organization has to make calculations about whose money to take and why, and I feel bad for the many good people who have (or were planning to) rely on SBF's funding for a genuinely good cause they believed in, only to have the rug ripped out from under them.
By all indications, SBF seemed like an interesting and decent dude. I followed him regularly. He was mega-rich, obviously, but also unique in the space and particularly good at selling a vision for a "better future." One where mega-rich people like him were honest about their intentions and cynicism. His attitude seemed to be: Get rich to spend on things you think are good. I'm okay with that, and appreciated what I took for transparency. That is the essence of the whole "effective altruism" movement. It's okay to do some "bad" things (from the effective altruists' perspective, like engaging in the depravity of capitalism) to do some "good" things (in SBF's case, invest in a bunch of liberal and charitable causes).
What we're getting instead is another lesson in how smart people with seemingly good intentions can do very shady, very bad, or very stupid things in an effort to "win." Perhaps, now that we're seeing the real SBF, the truth is he wasn't that smart or that good after all.
Which is a bummer. Because in the macro, his actions are going to hurt an industry like cryptocurrency that has a lot of potential. I'm a "believer" in the technology behind crypto and the potential for more economic dynamism. I own cryptocurrency that I bought years ago when it was just a moonshot idea. I watched the value of it grow and grow and grow, then collapse, then grow, then collapse, then stabilize and now — collapse again.
While making a few thousand dollars as a broke journalist was great, it was never really the point. The idea was that the "blockchain," the decentralized ledger propping up cryptocurrency transactions, was an opportunity to bring transparency to and level the power dynamics in spaces that have traditionally been rife with fraud and scams. I’m not even sure that its best use case is currency, but many of us who read enthusiastically about the space imagined a future where we relied on it for bank transactions and payments and plenty more.
Now, though, SBF has helped define that same space as one rife with fraud and scams, too. It's hard to overstate how much long-term damage his actions may do. However you feel about his politics, he was truly supposed to be one of the "good guys."
Without question, moments like this make me glad for regulators. As much as I sometimes loathe the government’s intrusiveness and inefficiency, the fact that the SEC and Justice Department are already investigating brings some comfort. Some hope, at least, that the people who lost their shirts might be made whole, and that if what SBF did is as bad as it looks, he will pay a sufficient price for his crimes.
As for the politics of it all, some of the stories are bogus and some are deeply concerning. The whole "Democrats funneled money through Ukraine and FTX" story seems to be mostly bogus. FTX allowed Ukrainian charitable funds to be delivered in crypto and then turn those funds into normal currency. There is no evidence Ukraine was re-routing any of that money to Democrats. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense. SBF was proudly and publicly dumping tens of millions of dollars into Democratic candidates, he didn't need a money laundering scheme to pass through Ukraine. Meanwhile, we can also see how the money sent to Ukraine using FTX has been spent.
More concerning, obviously, is just what this illustrates about how our political system works right now. The big money angle is plain as day. SBF gives cash to Democrats. Then SBF lobbies Democrats for certain regulatory rules to be passed in Congress. Democrats enthusiastically prop him up. Then SBF openly admits his "belief" in regulation was a complete public relations scam, all while it turns out his entire financial enterprise is being held up by sleight-of-hand. Some Democrats touting his ideas either took the story hook, line and sinker, or knew he was full of hot air and ran with him anyway. Neither outcome is a good look.
Unfortunately, huge, super-rich donors driving the agendas of Democrats is not a problem that is unique to them. SBF is just the latest to be exposed, but there are plenty of similar players on both sides of the aisle.
In the meantime, all I can hope is some of the people who got ripped off get their cash back. But I wouldn't hold my breath.

Your questions, answered.
Q: I saw several social media posts, including one from Viola Davis, attributing a Newsweek article that says 15,000 Iranian protesters were sentenced to death for protesting Mahsa Amini in Iran. Is this true or is this the internet being the internet?
— Carly from Morrisville, PA
Tangle: I saw this too. And it's basically nonsense. Our Instagram account was one of the first to debunk it.
The initial report was posted by Newsweek and became so widely circulated that even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — a man who has an entire intelligence apparatus at his fingertips — shared it.
Here is what is real: Thousands of protesters in Iran have been arrested. A handful — maybe five — have been sentenced to death. The 15,000 figure is a rough estimate of just how many people have been arrested. Sources reporting that figure have also said 350 have died in various ways during the protests.
With 15,000 people arrested, members of Iran's parliament signed a statement saying the people "waging a war against God" should be dealt with decisively. This was interpreted as a parliament plan to execute all 15,000 people. But after the report went viral, many members made it clear that is not what they meant. For what it's worth: These mistakes are much more common when U.S. journalists are covering shocking reports about nations that are adversaries of the U.S. and I encourage you to always view them with skepticism (Adam Johnson calls it the "North Korea rule of journalism").
Regardless, none of this should be comforting. So far, we know of five people that are likely going to be executed for a righteous protest against a regime that stifles free speech and the free movement of its own people. It’s certainly possible dozens or even hundreds more face the same fate. 15,000 have reportedly been arrested. It's okay to be irate and deeply concerned about what's happening in Iran, but there is no need for the invention of even more horror.

Under the radar.
A bill that will limit the use of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) in sexual harassment cases is heading to President Biden's desk. The U.S. House passed the Speak Out Act with bipartisan support on Wednesday, with a 315-109 vote. It passed the United States Senate unanimously. The bill only applies to NDAs that are signed before a dispute arises, the kind of agreement you sign on your first day of work. Axios has the story.

	•	~100. The number of Tangle readers who replied to yesterday's newsletter to tell me they had voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.
	•	Three. The number I counted, so far, who said they were likely or definitely going to be voting for Trump again in 2024.
	•	17.1%. The percentage of Tangle readers who said that, in the event of a Biden vs. Trump 2024 race, they would not vote or would vote for someone else.

Have a nice day.
An underwater buoy could be the future of renewable energy generation. A Scottish startup called AWS Ocean is testing Archimedes Waveswing, a contraption that harnesses the power of waves to turn them into energy. The 50-ton, buoy like device is tethered to the ocean floor and uses the force of passing waves to generate power. After six months at sea, a test model produced 80 kilowatts at its peak (for context, 10 kilowatts is enough to power an average home of a family of four). That was 20% better than expected. The International Renewable Energy Agency said there is enough energy in the motion of the oceans to power the entire planet. New Atlas has the story.

* Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. iPhone activation required on iPhone purchases made at an Apple Store with one of these national carriers: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, or T-Mobile. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. Available for qualifying applicants in the United States. If you reside in the U.S. territories, please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about accessing this offer or applying for Apple Card. Except for ACMI, this offer cannot be combined with other Apple promotion(s) or financing offers that are directed to individual end-user customers in the qualifying location. This offer also cannot be combined with the Apple Employee Purchase Plan or business loyalty pricing. Some method of payment types are not accepted under this offer. See checkout for details.

1. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase or added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all stores and may vary between in-store and online trade-in. Some stores may have additional requirements.

Delivery times vary according to your selected delivery address, availability of your items, and the time of day you place your order. Find a store to view local store hours or see checkout for estimated delivery. A signature is required for delivery. Drivers may ask for verbal confirmation of receipt from a safe distance to satisfy the signature requirement. 
3.

FTX FALLOUT 
4 key questions about the impact of FTX’s collapse
Last Friday, the beleaguered crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy after a stunning five-day collapse of the once-$32 billion dollar crypto empire. The company is now facing investigations in both the Bahamas and the U.S. for its handling of users’ assets. 
FTX’s books revealed the exchange had more than $9 billion in liabilities, but less than $1 billion in liquid assets the day before its bankruptcy filing. And after an apparent hack drained $477 million of the company’s remaining assets on Friday night, customers are facing long odds of ever recovering much of their deposits. At least $1 billion in customer funds are unaccounted for, and FTX may owe as many as one million creditors.
As the business world tries to keep pace with this fast-moving story, we’re attempting to answer a few bigger picture questions about FTX’s collapse and its implications for the crypto industry. Let’s dive in.  
How have crypto markets and businesses been affected?
	•	Crypto’s total market cap has dropped below the $1 trillion mark since FTX’s trouble started early last week, and sits near $826 billion as of Wednesday morning. After the firm’s Friday bankruptcy filing, BTC sank nearly 25%, dropping below $16,000, before slightly recovering; ETH fell by more than 30% in the same span.
	•	Market contagion and liquidity issues have spread to a growing number of crypto businesses, from lenders including Genesis Global Capital, BlockFi, and Voyager to web3 VCs like Paradigm, Ikigia, and Galois. On Wednesday, Genesis, a leading lender in the crypto industry, suspended redemptions, citing “extreme market dislocation … caused by the FTX implosion.” Last week, BlockFi halted withdrawals and cited “significant exposure to FTX.” They are now planning to file for bankruptcy. Voyager, a bankrupt lender that FTX had planned to purchase for $1.4 billion, no longer has a buyer, meaning its customers might not be able to recover funds. 
	•	FTX’s collapse has also disrupted the Solana ecosystem. The exchange was heavily invested in SOL and many of Solana’s DeFi projects were also allegedly backed by FTX. The token lost more than 60% of its value in the week after rumors of FTX’s insolvency began. 

Have larger investors and traditional firms been impacted?
	•	Since its founding in 2019, FTX raised nearly $2 billion in capital from sources like venture capital firms and pension funds, and its bankruptcy means that many of its investors will likely need to write their investments off as losses. 
	•	SoftBank, Tiger Global, and Sequoia Capital are among the many well-known firms who made now-worthless bets on FTX. Last Wednesday, Sequoia sent a letter to investors that the firm was marking its $213 million stake down to $0. 
	•	The impact isn’t limited to venture capital firms either — the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund lost $95 million investing in FTX’s funding rounds and athletes like tennis star Naomi Osaka and NFL quarterback Tom Brady are among the individuals who had equity stakes in the company. 

What does this mean for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S.?
	•	In the wake of the exchange’s collapse, there has been a chorus of calls from business leaders and lawmakers regarding the need for greater oversight of the crypto industry. U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, said last week: “It’s imperative that Congress establish a framework that ensures Americans have adequate protections while also allowing innovation to thrive here in the U.S.”
	•	Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong noted in an op-ed for CNBC on Friday that the U.S.’s confusing array of existing regulations have failed to provide a workable framework for how crypto services “can be offered in a safe, transparent way.” As a result, users have been engaging with risky, offshore platforms like FTX that have little regulatory oversight and are largely outside the protection of U.S. regulators.
	•	The solution, said Armstrong, is to create smarter regulation that protects consumers and makes the U.S. a more attractive place for crypto companies to operate. “Those of us who care about the future of crypto want to create sensible regulation for centralized exchanges and custodians in the U.S. and other regions,” he said. 

What should I know as a Coinbase customer?
Coinbase has a clear approach to transparency, risk management, and consumer protection, as outlined in a recent blog post by CFO Alesia Hass. Here’s the TLDR.
	•	Coinbase has very little exposure to FTX and our customers are not in any direct danger of liquidity or credit risk.
	•	There can never be a “run on the bank” at Coinbase because we hold all consumer assets 1:1, which can be reviewed in our publicly filed, audited financial statements. 
	•	Coinbase is extremely well capitalized, with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
	•	Our risk team has decades of experience managing trading and credit businesses across a range of economic cycles. Our prudent approach to risk management is part of how we keep customers safe.

Additional resources from around Coinbase
	•	There has been a surge in questions this week around how to safely and securely transfer assets to Coinbase. Here’s a guide to doing so. And if you’re looking for an alternative to import your self-custody wallet, check out Coinbase Wallet. You can import today following these steps and pay no gas fees along the way.
	•	Brian Armstrong will be hosting a Twitter Spaces with Ryan Selkis, co-founder and CEO of Messari, on Wednesday November 16 from 11am-12pm PT to talk about the FTX news and where we go from here.  If you miss the chance to listen live, you can find a recording of this conversation through our Around the Block podcast on Thursday via Spotify or YouTube.
	•	Coinbase’s Institutional Research team has published a new report that looks at how the FTX bankruptcy could continue to impact the crypto industry.

POLITICAL CAPITAL 
How U.S. midterm election results could impact crypto regulations
According to a recent survey conducted by GMI PAC, a crypto-focused group, 44% of U.S. voters are “crypto voters,” which pollsters define as owning or considering owning digital assets. With the U.S. midterm results nearly settled, and calls for clear crypto regulation mounting in the wake of FTX’s collapse, a group of newly elected, and re-elected, politicians in Washington will likely play a pivotal role in shaping the regulatory conversation. Here’s a quick look at some of those politicians. 
	•	Rep. Harriet Hageman: A newly elected Republican from Wyoming, a state that has taken a leading role in proposing crypto-friendly laws, Hageman is a proponent of limiting the federal government’s influence over parts of the industry, like mining operations. Crypto is “an important states’ rights issue,” she said over the summer. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a vocal crypto advocate and co-author of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, called Hageman “an excellent teammate” to have in Washington.
	•	Rep. Jonathan Jackson: An incoming Democrat from Illinois, Jackson was propelled to office in part due to a swath of donations from crypto-related political groups including Three PACs, DAO for America, Web3 Forward, and Protect Our Future. Jackson has said he supports regulations that promote innovation “and add clarity and protection for those entering this burgeoning arena.”
	•	The Congressional Blockchain Caucus: Several representatives in this bipartisan group won re-election, including chairs Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.), and caucus members Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), and Richie Torres (D-N.Y.) The congressional group says that it supports a “light touch regulatory approach” and is focused on blockchain technology applications like “identity management, asset tracking and ownership, healthcare records management, [and] intellectual property rights.”  

Why it matters… As calls for regulatory clarity grow from business leaders and politicians alike, the 118th U.S. Congress will likely face increased pressure to formulate clear laws to guide the crypto industry in the U.S. A possible starting point? Three key bills proposed earlier this year are already awaiting congressional action in 2023.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund, exchange-traded fund, or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

This information is intended to be educational and is not tailored to the investment needs of any specific investor.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.

There are additional costs associated with option strategies that call for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads, straddles, and collars, as compared to a single option trade.
Sector investing can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry.

Diversification cannot ensure a profit or protect against loss.

Fidelity does not provide legal or tax advice and the information provided above is general in nature and should not be considered legal or tax advice. Consult with an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.

Foreign markets can be more volatile than U.S. markets due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, market, or economic developments, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. These risks are particularly significant for investments that focus on a single country or region.

Here's some good advice from Dr. Evans on how to read a math book.  
Dr. Evans sent this out earlier this year, but several of you said you hadn't seen it.  

I made a small video about how I would read Volume 1 section 1.1.

Also, I have some written notes on this you may find useful (attached)

Hi Bryant McArthur, 
Online shoppers have their pick of millions of products from large retailers, yet so many options to explore can be overwhelming. Even shoppers who want to make a purchase can end up with empty carts—unless data science could enhance retailers' ability to predict which products each customer actually wants to see, add to their cart, and order in real time.   In this competition, you’ll predict e-commerce clicks, cart additions, and orders by building a multi-objective recommender system based on previous events in a user session. 
Total Prizes: 
$30,000 
Entry Deadline: 
January 24th, 2023

 You could help improve the shopping experience for everyone involved, from customers who will receive more tailored recommendations to online retailers who may increase their sales.   Good luck,   Walter Reade  Kaggle Data Scientist

Hi there,  Today we have two huge announcements. I break it down in the video above; if you don’t want to watch that, you can read on for the short version.
Descript Storyboard, our transformative redesign, is now available
First, we’re releasing Descript Storyboard, the all-new version of Descript that’s been in preview for a few months. It’s a whole new way of making video and, we believe, a huge step toward making it as easy to create and communicate with video as it is with docs or slides. We’ve been working on it for over a year, and we couldn’t be more excited to turn it loose and see what you can do with it.
We know you’ll have lots of questions, and we’ve got lots of places you can go for answers:
	•	Take a tour of the new Descript   
	•	Try a tutorial demo, or see a live walkthrough and AMA on Thursday
	•	Come to my video office hours in our Discord, at 9am PT every day for the next week or so
	•	See everything that’s changed — and a ton of other resources in our new Help Center 
Try Descript Pro for Free
Also, to help you get acquainted with the new Descript, we’re offering 7 days of Descript Pro for free. You’ll get unlimited access to new features like AI green screen and stock media, plus classic Descript magic like Overdub and Studio Sound — and you don’t have to give us your credit card.
Start your trial 
OpenAI Startup Fund leads our Series C
Second, we’re announcing a partnership with OpenAI, and a $50 million investment led by the OpenAI Startup Fund. OpenAI is leading the development of incredible new tools that are going to change the way creators, communicators, and everybody works. I talk more about that in the video up there 👆.  That’s it – almost! If you've made it this far, we'd love for you to check out the launch on Product Hunt and share your thoughts. Otherwise, I can’t wait to hear from you at the AMA or on Discord – or to see what you create with the new Descript.
Andrew Mason, CEO, Descript

Just picture yourself heading out to your vehicle on a cold winter’s night. It’s been a long day at the office, and all you want to do is get home, have a hot meal, and get some rest. You slide into the driver’s seat, turn the keys in the ignition, and are greeted by the ominous sound of clicking rather than the roar of an engine coming to life. 

 
 
 
 
 

Whether you’ve acquired a high-mileage beater or have been nursing the same car along for over a decade, it’s crucial that you properly care for your aging vehicle. Cars develop particular needs as they bank more and more miles on the odometer. To help ensure that your high-mileage vehicle won’t reach the end of its lifespan anytime soon, here is some advice for maintaining a car that’s surpassed 75,000 miles.

What the latest inflation numbers mean.

The latest inflation numbers could signal some good news for President Biden. Photo: Gage Skidmore / Wikicommons
I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 11 minutes. 
💵
We're covering the latest inflation numbers and what they mean (some good news, maybe?)... plus, a question about what candidates do with leftover campaign funds and an under the radar story about Adderall. 

Correction. 
In yesterday's newsletter, I wrote that "Democrats also won several key swing-state gubernatorial races, assuring executive control in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada." In fact, Democrats lost Nevada's gubernatorial race, in which incumbent governor Steve Sisolak was unseated by Republican Joe Lombardo.
This error is brought to you by a sleep-deprived election week in which I traveled to and from California and spent the weekend at a work conference in Palm Springs. I'm excited to get back on a normal schedule this week.
This is our 72nd correction in Tangle's 171-week history and our first correction since November 9th. I track corrections and place them at the top of the newsletter in an effort to maximize transparency with readers.

Quick hits.
	1.	Former President Donald Trump is widely expected to announce a 2024 presidential run this evening. (The announcement) 
	2.	Katie Hobbs (D) defeated Kari Lake (R) in Arizona's race for governor. (The results) 
	3.	The suspect in a University of Virginia shooting who killed three people and injured two others has been arrested and charged with second degree murder. (The suspect) 
	4.	Amazon is expected to lay off more than 10,000 employees this week, according to several news reports. (The purge) 
	5.	An Iranian court has reportedly issued its first death sentence for anti-government protests, while sentencing five other defendants to up to 10 years in prison. (The sentence)

Today's topic. 
Inflation. We have been covering inflation and the latest Labor Department reports every month since May, since this year’s midterm voters continually pointed to it as their number one concern in the country. Reminder: Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is designed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure price fluctuations for urban buyers, who represent the vast majority of Americans. The CPI tracks 80,000 items in a fixed basket of goods and services, representing everything from gasoline to apples to the cost of a doctor's visit.
On Thursday, in the midst of a sea of news about the election results, the Labor Department released its latest inflation numbers. The CPI rose 7.7% annually in October, the first time annual inflation rates have fallen below 8% in eight months, giving the Federal Reserve its strongest signal yet that inflation may be slowing. Meanwhile, the CPI rose 0.4% in October after climbing by the same margin in September, which was below the 0.6% that economists had predicted.
Over half of the increase in CPI was driven by soaring rents, while gasoline prices ticked back up after three months of decreases. Food prices at the grocery store continued to skyrocket, up 12.4% on the year, while the cost of food at restaurants is up 8.6%.
Despite that, the encouraging signs spurred a major rally on Wall Street and sent U.S. Treasury yields tumbling (treasury yields are effectively the yearly interest rate the U.S. government pays on money it borrows to raise capital through selling Treasury bonds; when yields go up, banks usually have to respond by raising interest rates on the people they lend to).
Core CPI, the measure of inflation with more volatile food and energy prices removed, went up 6.3% annually, down from 6.6% in September. At a monthly rate, the core CPI climbed just 0.3%, down from the 0.6% it had risen between August and September.
“It’s pretty clear that inflation has definitely peaked and is rolling over," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said. "All the trend lines suggest that it will continue to moderate going forward, assuming that nothing goes off the rails.”
Others expressed more caution, noting that the rate is still well above the Fed's 2% target, while prices for rent and food continue to rise.
“One month of data does not a victory make, and I think it’s really important to be thoughtful that this is just one piece of positive information, but we’re looking at a whole set of information,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions from the left and right, then my take. You can find all our previous inflation coverage here.

What the right is saying. 
	•	Many on the right are skeptical this is the end, but share some optimism about finally seeing reliably good numbers.
	•	Some warn that we've seen this before, and the dawn never came.
	•	Others say a Republican-controlled House could help slow inflation by reducing the Biden administration’s spending.
The Wall Street Journal called it a "modest reprieve" and warned that it might be temporary.
“An increase of 7.7% in the overall consumer-price index compared to a year ago remains unusually high, although it marks the fourth monthly decline in the inflation rate from a peak of 9.1% in June. Core inflation excluding food and energy was 6.3%, which is down from 6.6% in September but has yet to show a lasting downward trend," the board said. "Investors (desperately want to) believe this means inflation is coming under control. Some caveats are in order. Prices still are rising at an abnormally fast pace, and households will notice that a falling inflation rate is not a stable price level. Much of the disinflation comes via prices for goods, which declined 0.4% from September to October, notably for durables such as appliances. This is a result of a cooling housing market and is the kind of demand destruction the Fed says it wants to achieve.
“Prices for services, in contrast, rose 0.5% month-to-month, and food and energy prices rose by 0.6% and 1.8% respectively on a monthly basis. Inflation remains widespread across the economy and thus hard to tamp down. One consequence of leaning on the Fed to fight inflation on its own by suppressing demand is that households are left with few ways to boost their standard of living. Inflation-adjusted weekly earnings fell in October, and are now down 3.7% in the last 12 months,” the board said. “At this rate it will take a long time for households to recover the purchasing power they’ve lost during this inflationary bout, even if the inflation rate moderates. Congress and the Biden Administration could help with policies to stimulate productive investment to fuel new supply and real wage growth, but on Wednesday President Biden was still deploring ‘trickle-down’ policies. There’s only been falling real incomes on his economic watch.”
In The New York Post, Brian Riedl said a GOP-led House will help address inflation by stopping Biden's enormous spending.
“Yes, much of the inflation reflects an economic hangover from the pandemic. Yet President Biden and Democrats have actively driven prices higher through energy regulations, tariffs, buy America rules, tightened ethanol mandates, Davis-Bacon rules raising construction costs, and restrictions on new building. Most destructive of all has been the president’s historic spending spree, which has added $4.8 trillion to the 10-year budget deficit. The Federal Reserve calculates that the President’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was a major inflation contributor. The student loan bailout — if it survives legal challenges — will push inflation even higher. That will force the Federal Reserve to further rate-hike the economy into a likely recession, with significant job losses.
“And that is why it was so important for Tuesday’s voters to stage an intervention and take away President Biden’s credit card. While the results were less than expected, the current vote counts show that the majority of voters chose a Republican House, with inflation and the economy their top concerns,” Riedl wrote. “Republicans may not have produced a comprehensive anti-inflation agenda, but their most valuable weapon will be gridlock. While Biden has already enacted $4.8 trillion in new spending, he had proposed a staggering $11 trillion during his 2020 campaign. Any chance of enacting the final $6.2 trillion in remaining promises — digging the inflation and deficit ditch even deeper — is almost surely dead with a GOP House.”
In National Review, Andrew Stuttaford said there was "some progress."
“Much of the easing of pressure was seen on the goods side, a function, in part, of retailers that “over-ordered” during the supply-chain mess and are now dumping inventories, but also a sign that might suggest that squeezed consumers are spending less,” Stuttaford wrote. “It is also worth noting that used-car prices, which have been in sharp focus since we began emerging from the pandemic, also eased on a month-on-month basis, and, in the view of the Wall Street Journal’s Justin Lahart, ought to fall further. That seems reasonable. ‘Shelter,’ notes Lahart, is still pushing the headline number up, but that’s a lagging indicator.
“There are clear signs that rents have peaked, and house prices (which are reflected within this part of the index in a rather convoluted way) are clearly looking shaky. Shelter accounts for about a third of the index," Stuttaford said. "With the labor market still tight, I’d keep a[n] eye on wage pressure, which feeds, of course, into higher services prices. We’ve seen a false dawn before in this cycle, but there may be more reason this time to think that, absent an additional “external” shock, this may be the moment we have been waiting for. But even if this is the peak, we remain a long, long way from the 2 percent target (remember that?)."

What the left is saying.
	•	Some on the left are very optimistic about the numbers, and say Biden and the Fed are executing a good plan.
	•	Many argue that inflation has peaked.
	•	Others say the Fed cannot stop raising interest rates, and we need to be sure this is a consistent trend.
In Bloomberg, John Authers said reasons for optimism are adding up.
“The October consumer price inflation report proved to be better than the month before and much better than expected. Subsidiary statistical measures suggest that this peak in inflation, unlike several previous false dawns, may not prove to be illusory. An emphatically strong market reaction, with prices of both bonds and stocks rallying impressively, was justified," Authers said. "The headline year-on-year inflation rate dipped again and so — crucially — did the ‘core’ measure that includes the highly variable prices of food and fuel. The alarming and almost constant increases that started early last year have ended... The last time core inflation came in this far under the consensus expectation compiled by Bloomberg was in early 2020, just as the pandemic took hold.
 
Chart from the Cleveland Fed included for commentary below
“More important still, underlying metrics confirmed that this time might really be the peak, in a way they conspicuously failed to do earlier this year when core CPI last seemed to have started a descent. The chart [above] shows the ‘trimmed mean’ inflation produced by the Cleveland Fed that excludes the biggest outliers in either direction from the index’s components, and takes the average of the rest; and the ‘sticky’ inflation measure produced by the Atlanta Fed, which looks only at the goods and services whose prices are hardest to change,” Authers said. “In practice, when these measures rise, it’s taken as a sign that inflationary pressure is gaining strength; and so it’s good to see that while both remain very elevated, the trimmed mean has dipped slightly, while sticky price inflation is unchanged. This is consistent with the notion that the overall peak is in, although doesn’t prove it.”
In The Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin celebrated the possibility of the so-called "soft landing."
“If the markets rallied because they were expecting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell to curtail rate hikes, they have misjudged him. When announcing the last rate hike earlier this month, he warned, ‘It is very premature to be thinking about pausing. People when they hear “lags,” they think about a pause.’ He added... Caution is warranted,” Rubin wrote. “An early inflation hawk, Lawrence H. Summers, echoed that view on Thursday after the CPI number came out. ‘Encouraging CPI number. This is comparable on the low side to some of the earlier surprises on the high side,’ he tweeted. ‘Cannot make judgements on a single monthly number, but this is not one that can be dismissed.’
“The administration, meanwhile, will be constrained in new spending because of a closely divided Congress. If so, Biden’s deficit reduction total ($1.7 trillion so far) may increase. While politically frustrating for the administration, focusing on protecting and implementing its agenda rather than adding new spending items may prove economically advantageous," Rubin wrote. "Biden correctly claims the United States is in an enviable position internationally. Russia’s economy is collapsing; China has been stymied by the pandemic. Britain and the European Union face rocky economic times... The United States remains the most attractive venue to spend your money, the country most likely to come out of the post-pandemic turbulence in the best condition.”
In The New Republic, Timothy Noah said inflation is dwindling — and there's even a growing possibility we can avoid a recession.
"Inflation peaked five months ago: October was the fourth consecutive month during which the overall inflation rate fell," Noah wrote. "Between June and September, core inflation rose from 5.9 percent to the aforementioned 6.6 percent, and that was bad. Now it’s going down, and that’s good. The Fed’s preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, showed a much milder core-inflation increase between June and September than the CPI—0.1 percentage point—which perhaps deserved more attention than it got. We don’t yet know what happened to the PCE index in October, but probably, like the CPI, it went down.
"A week ago I wrote that ordinary Americans were worrying more about inflation than the Federal Reserve was, and that this struck me as excessive. But did they listen? Enough, perhaps, to avoid the predicted 'red wave'... Fifty-four percent of voters said they trusted Republicans more than Democrats to tackle inflation, even though the Republican answer to inflation, like the Republican answer to everything else, is to cut taxes—which would increase rather than reduce inflation," Noah wrote. "Of that 54 percent, a shocking 9 percent were people who voted Democratic! This might be a good moment to remind everybody that Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman widely celebrated for ending the Great Inflation of the 1970s by bringing on what was at that time the worst recession since the Great Depression, was a Democratic appointee. As I’ve written before, the economy consistently runs better under Democratic presidents, and that includes lower inflation."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	It's hard to be optimistic, given how many times we've gotten some encouraging signs.
	•	This does seem a little different, in that many commentators on the right are also hopeful.
	•	The reasons to be skeptical now are different than they were three or four months ago. 
Look, I'm hopeful. But we've also seen this before.
As I've previously noted, over the course of the last year, the commentators considered "on the right" have been the ones who've mostly gotten their calls about inflation right. Whether that's due to their own negative bias toward Biden or not, every time we've had some light at the end of the tunnel it has instead been an oncoming train. I was encouraged to see some conservative economists and pundits, this time, saying yes, this really might be a good sign. But my optimism is cautious given what we've seen.
The last time we were truly optimistic about inflation was in September, when Biden was heralding “zero” inflation but there were major caveats that the core CPI was still rising. Back then, the optimism was very one-sided, and many economists and pundits with center or right-wing views warned that the report wasn’t as good as the White House was making it out to be. They were right. This time, economists from across the board seem moderately optimistic, and if there is a reason for concern, it’s different from why we were worried in September.
The biggest caveat that I've found to these numbers came from Jonathan Levin in Bloomberg, who wrote a very informative piece about how the pricing of healthcare is being skewed by a methodology quirk. The short version is that health insurance inflation rate data is updated once a year and spread out over 12 months, and the latest batch of data is being pulled down by a misleading drop in costs. Similar to how housing inflation is a lagging indicator (because leases are often signed for a year), healthcare costs may be showing deflationary numbers because they're comparing last year's health costs to this year's economy. Healthcare costs could be rising, but we don't see those figures yet.
Is this a small asterisk or a big one? I'm comfortable saying I truly don't know. Economists can't even seem to agree.
Either way, Thursday's report is just one data point, and we'll need a few more before we can really call deflation a trend. When it comes to practical implications, there is no reason the Fed should let up (yet) on raising interest rates. If it's working, keep doing it. If it isn't working (or if this does prove to be only a blip), they'll be much happier in a month if they don't let up now. The cost of food, gas and shelter were all up last month, and those are the costs that the broadest swathe of Americans feel most acutely.
Of course, politically, Biden can celebrate a strong week: Unexpected success in the midterms, a report on inflation that even his critics are welcoming, and a highly-anticipated meeting with China's President Xi that points to the potential for bilateral relations between China and the U.S. improving. More than anything else, the last seven days are yet another reminder of just how quickly political fortunes can change.

Your questions, answered.
Q: How do candidates use excess campaign funds? What limitations are applied to these funds and who polices the use of these funds?
— Ellis from Blythewood, South Carolina
Tangle: Great question. The vague, unsatisfying answer is that it depends a little bit on what state, what type of election, and who or where the money came from (or what it went to — a candidate directly, or a Super PAC).
That being said, generally speaking, the leftover money cannot be used for any personal purposes or stowed away. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is the organization that polices these rules.
The funds have to be used on donations to charities, other candidates running for office, transfers to political parties, or future races for the same candidate. So, for instance, Blake Masters (who lost in Arizona's Senate race) could keep any leftover money that was donated and then use it to run again in a few years. Or he could donate it to the RNC. Or he could donate it to other candidates. Some candidates will create slush funds, where they start "leadership" PACs and then use that money to advance a certain political agenda or other candidates.
The big no-no with political donations is basically anything that is personal. For instance, you are violating the law if you take that leftover money and go buy a home. You also can't just hire a bunch of friends and family members to some bogus position and pay them — they need to prove that they are doing actual political work for an actual campaign, otherwise you are violating campaign finance rules.
Typically, the most unspent money you'll see is sitting in a super PAC, which — by the letter of the law — isn't allowed to coordinate with campaigns. So when they have money left over, what they usually do is support that same candidate at a future date or other candidates of the same party. Every now and then, Super PACs will even reimburse donors for money spent on a losing campaign.

Under the radar. 
In the United States last year, 41.4 million Adderall prescriptions were dispensed, up 10% from 2020. The drug, which is commonly used to treat ADHD or hyperactivity disorder, is in such high demand that there is now a shortage in the U.S. Some regular users are experiencing stimulant withdrawal, while others are turning to unregulated dealers or illegal drugs as substitutes. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a nationwide shortage. Whether Adderall is overprescribed in the U.S. is a question worth asking, but in the immediate term the issue at hand is what will happen (and is already happening) to Americans cut off from a stimulant they have been prescribed and regularly taken for years. WIRED has the story.

Numbers.
	•	8 billion. The estimated population of earth, as of today, according to projections from the United Nations.
	•	Triple. The global population size today compared to 1950.
	•	0.6%. The drop in medical care services costs over the last month, according to the latest BLS report.
	•	2.4%. The drop in used vehicle prices over the last month, according to the latest BLS report.
	•	0.8%. The rise in shelter costs over the last month, according to the latest BLS report.
	•	0.6%. The rise in food costs over the last month, according to the latest BLS report.

Have a nice day. 
Salt Lake City's city council is going to test an innovative idea to address homelessness. The council voted last week to build a community of "tiny homes" for people experiencing chronic homelessness in a project they hope can become a model for other cities. The Other Side Village is the organization behind the project, which plans to provide permanent housing to the homeless and specifically target those with mental illness or addiction issues. Along with 60 fully equipped homes, the neighborhood will have stores and employment opportunities for residents to encourage them to spend time in the village. NPR has the story, along with advice from the organizers about how the broader issue of homelessness might be better addressed.

This use-inspired basic research degree is designed to produce independent scholars, well-prepared educators and cutting-edge researchers poised to excel in their professional careers within disciplinary, interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary environments in academia, government and industry. Although it is quite young among computing PhD programs, started in 2006, it has already gained national high reputation, as evidenced from reputation-based US News ranking and top-tier publication based CSRANKINGS.org ranking.
                                                                                                          
The Ph.D. Admissions Committee will review all completed applications submitted by December 31, 2022. After that date, applications will be reviewed on a space available basis. All decisions are expected to be made by April 15, 2023. In general, Fall Semester is the entry semester to begin study for the Ph.D. degree.
Come to one of our Zoom information sessions scheduled from 5:00-6:30 PM to find out more about our program.

Subject: Repent!
Date: November 14, 2022 at 4:32:28 PM MST
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Bcc: Bryant0918@gmail.com

Buenas tardes!

My sincerest apologies for neglecting to send an email last week. But I have repented and here I am!

Elder Kingrey and I are here in Hurricane and we are loving it! We have been all over the place these past two weeks, and this upcoming week will be just as crazy. We have Elder Pearson conducting a mission tour starting tomorrow which will go through Friday. He is providing two days of instruction to the mission on Wednesday and Thursday. We are all very excited.

I treasure my time studying in the morning. I have been continuing to read 5-7 pages of the Book of Mormon in Spanish every day in conjunction with the whole mission's challenge to read the BoM in 3 months while marking all the doctrines of Christ. As I've been noticing how much the word 'repentance' has been coming up. One of my favorite verses has been, verse 10 of Mosiah 4:

10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.

Friends, family, we all have things we know we need to repent of! I know I sure do. This week I am repenting of my slothfulness in the mornings. I have neglected my morning exercises recently in favor of being idle. I commit to doing morning exercise every day this week (besides Sunday).

What will you repent of this week?

Highs:
-Heidi is getting baptized on Sunday!
-Went up to Moroni for exchanges!
-We blitzed a trailer park as a ward! Big success.

Lows:
-Neglecting morning exercise
-Paperwork
-Daylight savings time

Today's read: 11 minutes.
🇺🇸
We're covering the results from the 2022 midterms, including Democrats officially taking the Senate. Plus, a question about why some results take so long to come in, and an important under the radar story about Taiwan.

Quick hits.
	1.	U.S. inflation slowed more than forecasters expected, rising 7.7% in October from a year ago, while the core consumer price index increased 0.3% from the prior month. The stock market rallied on the news. (The numbers)
	2.	A federal judge in Texas ruled that President Biden's plan to erase student loan debt was unlawful, throwing its future into question. The education department is suspending student debt relief applications. (The block)
	3.	Ukrainian forces reclaimed the southern port city Kherson after Russian forces vacated the territory. (The reclamation)
	4.	Chris Magnus, the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is being forced out of the agency as record levels of migrants continue to enter the U.S. from Mexico. (The border)
	5.	President Biden is with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Bali on Monday. (The meeting)

Today's topic.
The Senate. On Saturday night, Catherine Cortez Masto (D) defeated Adam Laxalt (R) in Nevada's Senate race, assuring Democrats 50 seats and a Senate majority for the next two years. The victory means Democrats will head into the December 6 runoff in Georgia’s Senate race with an opportunity to gain a seat in a midterm election where they were widely expected to lose their majority.
Nearly a week after election night, the race for the House majority is still too close to call, though Democrats would have to win all five remaining toss-up seats to retain the majority.
 
Dave Wasserman

New House math:

Dem called/likely (213), incl. #AKAL, #CA09, #CA21, #CA47, #CA49, #CO08, #ME02, #OR06
GOP called/likely (217): incl. #CA03, #CA27, #CA45, #CO03, #NY22, #OR05
Toss Ups (5): #AZ01, #AZ06, #CA13, #CA22, #CA41

Dems need to run the table on the last five for 218.

By retaining control of the Senate with an opportunity to pick up a seat in December, and keeping the House race so competitive, Democrats can boast the strongest midterm showing in two decades for a party holding the White House. Party leaders and strategists have credited the fall of Roe v. Wade and the unpopularity of former President Donald Trump’s preferred candidates for galvanizing their base and attracting moderates, while also pointing to critical strategic decisions about which races to invest in for their surprising success (we'll be doing a post-mortem on the midterms in this week's Friday edition).
Along with winning a Senate majority and mitigating potential losses in the House, Democrats also won several key swing-state gubernatorial races, assuring executive control in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. The governor's race in Arizona is still too close to call, however, and one notable defeat came in Georgia, where Republican Brian Kemp easily defeated Stacey Abrams. Meanwhile, numerous Republican candidates running for secretary of state positions in swing states who questioned or denied the results of the 2020 election have all lost. None, so far, have refused to concede or openly questioned the results.
Today, we're going to explore some reactions from the left and right to the latest results, then my take. You can find all our previous midterm coverage here.

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left celebrate the victory, and point to abortion and concern for democracy as the major reasons Democrats performed so well.
	•	Some celebrated Republicans like Liz Cheney who broke from their party and endorsed Democrats.
	•	Others emphasized Democrats’ successful legislative agenda and said they should keep pushing for more progressive programs.
In The New York Times, Lisa Lerer emphasized abortion as the reason Democrats prevailed.
"Support for abortion rights now appears to be one of the big reasons Democrats defied history and staved off deep midterm losses," she said. "Democratic campaigns invested more heavily in abortion rights than any other topic, riding a wave of anger after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. In total, Democrats and their allies spent nearly half a billion dollars on ads mentioning abortion — more than twice what they spent on crime, and eight times as much as Republicans spent on abortion, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking firm. In Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico and elsewhere, abortion rights emerged as a driving force in the midterm elections, helping Democrats win ballot measures, governor’s races and House seats.
“In several states where the future of abortion rights rested on the outcomes of state legislative and governor’s races, voters said the issue was pivotal, according to exit polls conducted by TV networks and Edison Research,” Lerer wrote. “In Pennsylvania, abortion overtook the economy as the top issue on voters’ minds. Democrats there won a Senate race, critical to their hopes of maintaining a Senate majority, as well as the governor’s mansion, and they seemed poised to flip control of the State House of Representatives. In Michigan, where nearly half of voters said abortion was their top issue, Democrats won both chambers of the Legislature and re-elected Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, giving the party a trifecta of power for the first time in 40 years.”
Jacob Gardenswartz said there were two winners in this election: democracy and Liz Cheney.
“Democrats were most successful in the races where they clearly and consistently articulated the threat of Republican authoritarianism: John Fetterman and Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Gretchen Whitmer and Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, Tony Evers in Wisconsin, Steve Simon in Minnesota, and Maggie Toulouse Oliver in New Mexico,” Gardenswartz said. “Each emerged victorious against GOP challengers who denied or questioned the results of the 2020 election. In exit polls, nearly eight in 10 voters said they felt ‘confident’ in the fairness and accuracy of elections, with 68 percent indicating that they felt democracy was under attack.
“And in several key races, Democrats relied on an unlikely messenger to hammer home the message of their opponents’ extremism: outgoing Republican Representative Liz Cheney,” Gardenswartz said. “Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, has become something of a crusader against Trump and others in her party who continue to push falsehoods about 2020. A week before the election, she went so far as to endorse and campaign for several Democrats facing election deniers as opponent[s]... if Democrats learn anything from Tuesday, it’s that they should lean more into pro-democracy messages that plainly lay out the stakes if GOP election deniers take charge… Support for abortion rights now appears to be one of the big reasons Democrats defied history and staved off deep midterm losses.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Democrats won on the backs of negotiating Medicare, infrastructure bills, capping insulin costs, taxing corporations, and canceling student debt — and now it’s time to do more.
"A few lobbyist-friendly Democrats in our own party blocked much of the president’s agenda for working families. They torpedoed the president’s plan to reverse the Trump tax giveaways. They blocked proposals to cut skyrocketing housing and child care costs,” Warren wrote. “They thwarted efforts to fight corruption, end gerrymandering, defend democracy and protect abortion rights. If these Democrats had listened to voters instead of special interests, we would be in an even stronger electoral position today because we would have delivered even more for Americans... Americans understand that the economic well-being of families is inextricably linked to democracy and to individual rights, even if too many cable news gurus do not.
“A majority of Americans know that abortion is a kitchen-table issue that is central to both health and economic security, not a distraction. Americans understand that prices are rising in part because of corporate greed, and want a government on their side. Tuesday’s results confirmed those views: across America, every ballot initiative to protect abortion rights passed, along with many proposals to tax the wealthy and put money in workers’ pockets,” Warren said. “The so-called experts who called Democrats’ messaging incoherent were just plain wrong — and candidates who ignored their advice won. John Fetterman embraced populist economic policies and called out corporate greed, and won. Raphael Warnock took a central role in urging the president to cancel student debt, and is strongly positioned to win in Georgia. Many Democratic candidates leaned hard into protecting abortion rights and democracy while also aggressively supporting popular economic plans.”

What the right is saying.
	•	The right is divided about the results, with some blaming Trump and others blaming establishment Republicans.
	•	Some argue that there is still a path forward for a strong 2024 cycle for Republicans.
	•	Others are celebrating Republican gains in states like New York.
In The Washington Post, Hugh Hewitt said the path to a successful 2024 for Republicans hasn't changed.
"Right now, Republicans are overcorrecting to deep disappointment, and of course there are recriminations, egged on by Blue Bubble media and Democratic activists who would love to see a GOP civil war," Hewitt wrote. "What ought to matter to Constitution-first conservatives is that the House, as of Sunday morning, is still more likely than not to go Republican and, if it does, the GOP can (1) set up a select committee on China and (2) attend to a depleted Pentagon budget while (3) conducting vigorous oversight of federal agencies that are failing, especially Homeland Security. A small majority can do these things, and they matter, both on the substance and with voters. Go that way. And put hard votes in front of the Democrats while standing as a wall against the excesses of the past two years.
"On the Senate side, every 10 years like clockwork the GOP forgets that candidates who win primaries are sometimes too far to the right for the general. Republicans cannot wish away independents who do not want abortion rights ended, only limited. They cannot wish away young voters. The Buckley Rule abides: Nominate the most conservative candidate who can win. The Republicans didn’t. McConnell warned them, but he did his part for those who were viable — J.D. Vance in Ohio (successfully) and Adam Laxalt in Nevada (the most disappointing loss of the election)," Hewitt said. "In the closely divided chamber, the GOP should stick with the guy who had the guts and acumen to do what it took to secure a conservative Supreme Court majority. The Senate Republicans, whether they total 49 or 50, will remain a check on the administration. Let the battle-tested McConnell chart the course to a last, legacy-burnishing turn at Senate majority leadership [in 2024]."
In The Federalist, Tristan Justice wrote the case against Mitch McConnell for Senate leader.
"McConnell’s super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, went on to gut desperately needed campaign cash from conservative candidates in Arizona and New Hampshire who refused to kiss the ring of Washington monarchs," Justice said. "In Arizona, McConnell axed $18 million from the race where Republican venture capitalist Blake Masters sought to bring down a well-funded Democrat incumbent. While the Masters race remains too close to call, Gen. Don Bolduc in New Hampshire was comfortably defeated by Democrat Sen. Maggie Hassan, who captured a second term despite multiple polls showing the Republican within the margins of error. Bolduc was similarly abandoned by the GOP leader with $5.6 million cut from the contest. Both Bolduc and Masters signaled support for another candidate to lead the Senate conference if elected to the upper chamber.
"McConnell took money from the competitive pick-up contests and redirected resources into Alaska and Colorado, the former featuring a race between two Republicans and the latter featuring a candidate who alienated the base," he wrote. "Alienating the base, however, has become routine practice for McConnell, who boasts a lower favorability rating than President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. In other words, McConnell is the most unpopular politician in the country, a fact Democrats used to their advantage in this election cycle by villainizing McConnell as the new GOP 'boogeyman.'... In Alaska, McConnell’s PAC spent more than $6 million to boost Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski over the state party’s endorsed challenger Kelly Tshibaka... Meanwhile in Colorado, Republican construction executive Joe O’Dea, who benefitted from $1.25 million of McConnell’s money, lost by 11 points with 88 percent of precincts reporting."
In The New York Post, newly elected Mike Lawler celebrated the "real" red wave in New York — and how Republicans can build on it.
"New Yorkers are getting sick and tired of woke liberalism, and it’s showing in pockets of voters once considered the base of the Democratic Party," Lawler said. "In short, there’s a crack in the traditional Democrat coalition, and Republicans have an enormous opportunity to expand that breach with time-tested arguments in the coming months and years. In the Hudson Valley, where I prevailed on Election Night over Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chairman Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney — the first time in 42 years that a DCCC chairman lost re-election — voters once considered unreachable by Republicans were an essential part of my victory. Latino, Asian, Jewish, and a growing number of African-American voters rejected woke orthodoxy and all that comes with it.
"In Southeast Brooklyn, one of the most ethnically diverse areas of the country, voters toppled three long-term incumbent Democrat state Assembly members, something that would have been unimaginable a couple of years ago. In areas of Queens, the same thing is occurring. First- and second- generation Americans are embracing the conservative ethos of hard work and personal responsibility over failed big-government liberalism... A great deal of credit goes to Congressman Lee Zeldin for running a smart, focused, and passionate anti-crime campaign in his narrow defeat last Tuesday," he said. "Of all the places where a red wave could have crested, few would have guessed it would have been here in New York, where Republicans will send as many as 11 new members of Congress to Washington, and a number of new state senators and assembly members to Albany. With hard work and compassionate outreach, this could just be the ­beginning."

My take. 
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	There are a lot of reasons for Democrats success, but abortion is probably #1.
	•	It's hard to imagine Republicans winning the final seat in Georgia.
	•	This midterm has played out very unevenly from state to state.
Welp, it sure wasn't what I originally expected.
As I said on Wednesday, I thought the odds of Democrats pulling off a Senate hold were pretty good based on everything we saw in the first 24 hours — and they now have a majority locked in. But I certainly didn't imagine this outcome a week ago.
I suspect that Democrats will end up picking up a seat by winning the runoff in Georgia, where there are three obstacles facing Republicans: 1) Why dump obscene amounts of money into a Senate race for a single seat that won't change the majority, especially when the Senate map looks so bad for Democrats in 2024? Sure, you want the seat locked down for six years, but it seems to me Republican donors will be far less motivated than Democrats, who could make either Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) or Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) irrelevant. How do you motivate Republican voters to come out when they understand it may not make a huge difference?
2) When Trump announces he is running for office, which he seems primed to do tomorrow, Democrats will be even more highly motivated to turn out.
3) Most crucially, Walker is clearly a weak candidate. Other Republicans running for state offices in Georgia cleaned house, and margins suggest that voters there have concerns about Walker — otherwise he would have kept pace with them. I have a hard time seeing how Republicans manage to get the vote out, or whether they'll be as motivated as Democrats to fundraise and pour money into the race.
As for the why of what just happened — I'll talk about that more in this week's Friday edition, and I think we still need to get all the results and data in. But based on the evidence we have so far — more than threats to democracy or gerrymandering or Trump’s drag on the party or concerns about crime — the issue of abortion rights seems to have had the most outsized impact on the midterms. I’m sure these other factors played a part, and candidate quality was an issue, too: Mehmet Oz was a carpetbagger, Blake Masters wasn't experienced or well funded, Adam Laxalt was unable to navigate the abortion issue, and Herschel Walker was, well, Herschel Walker.
Still, it was a great week for democracy. Not because of who won and lost, but because of how they won and lost. None of the predictions about waves of people refusing to concede, violence in the streets, or widespread distrust in the results came to fruition. Candidates are losing, admitting they lost, and going quietly. Which surprised me. The fact that I was surprised makes me think I might have been consuming too much left-wing content around the threats to democracy in this upcoming election, which is a piece of self-reflection I left with. I was also glad to see that it's a bad campaign strategy to deny the results of a previous election, given how poorly all those candidates fared. One imagines telling voters elections are rigged may not be a great way to get them to actually vote.
It's a welcome development for a country that relies on peaceful transfers of power to function. No peals of protest like we had in 2020, and very few calls of voter suppression like the ones that echoed from Clinton’s 2016 campaign. Despite some skepticism Americans have about how our elections work, the vast majority seem (for now) comfortable with the outcomes in the 2022 midterms. It has been a long time since I could say that about an election.
What’s even more fascinating about 2022 is just how different the election appears depending on where you look. In New York, Oregon and Florida, Republicans did clean Democrats’ clock with issues like crime or inflation or “anti-woke” rhetoric. Yet in states like Pennsylvania or Michigan, where conditions seemed favorable for major Democratic losses, the opposite happened. Despite the nationalization of our politics, this was a very uneven primary election.
The House majority obviously still matters, and it's currently on a knife's edge. But, as was true last week, Republicans still have the inside track. I don't see that changing.
One thing you can bet on, though, is that the House will be a mess. Republicans are going to have an ugly battle over leadership positions. Even if they win a majority, it'll be a small one, which gives outsized power to individual members, which creates chaos and infighting.
Republicans are also going to be welcoming several new House members from New York and California, who are not going to vote consistently with House Republican leadership. Many of them will need to appease voters in purple districts. In simple terms: It's going to be a nearly impossible group to wrangle.

Your questions, answered.
Q: Why do election results take so long now?
— Sam from southern California
Tangle: For starters, they don't take this long everywhere. Elections in several highly-watched states, like Florida and Pennsylvania, basically had results for us on the night of the election. That is due in part to the races there not being very close. To be sure, tight races make ensuring you know who is the winner a little more time-consuming, and I'd put that at the top of the list of reasons why a vote count may go on for days or even weeks.
The other reason is that states now have very different ways of conducting elections. One of the big distinctions between states, especially now, are those that process absentee and mail-in ballots before election day vs. those that process them on election day. Then, there are the states who allow those ballots to arrive in the days after election day and still count them. Which means you have to wait for all those votes to arrive in the mail before you begin processing and counting them. Many races that have been called are still processing overseas absentee and military ballots — it’s the ones in states that are both still processing these votes and are very competitive that are lasting so long.
What I often tell people is that the time it takes to count votes is usually a tradeoff between access and security. If you want to count votes as fast as possible, you have to make voting less accessible and less secure. If you want to make voting as accessible and secure as possible, you are generally going to end up with a much longer process: You'll get more votes via mail, more votes that are going to be counted even if they show up late, and in order to keep elections secure you'll have to do a lot of double-checking, processing, and ballot curing ( helping machines process votes that are illegible to the machine or reaching out to voters to fix ballots that weren't filled out properly).
This article has a good breakdown of why counting votes takes so long in California.
The good news is, we know where to look for answers. While Florida benefitted from not-very-close elections in 2022, they also have a superior system. They've made voting early easy and give anyone a take-home ballot who requests it. They start counting early votes when they come in, and they've standardized the system with 100% paper ballots. Nine million of the 11 million 2020 votes in Florida were cast early, there were basically zero issues, and we had reliable results on election night. Nationalized politics has driven Florida to make some unfortunate changes to the system that worked so well in 2020, but it still looked very good in 2022.
To me, allowing states to expand take-home voting and to start processing and counting those votes before Election Day are simple reforms worth implementing. But it'll require individual states following Florida’s lead for something like that to happen.

Under the radar. 
Congress is now deliberating on how to fund an unprecedented package of billions of dollars of military assistance to Taiwan in anticipation of a potential Chinese invasion of the island, according to The Washington Post. With Biden and China’s Xi Jinping set to meet in Bali on Monday, members of Congress are considering dipping into our own stocks of weapons and providing them to Taiwan through the foreign military financing program paid for by the United States. The idea would be to transfer weapons to Taiwan in a manner similar to the way the U.S. did for Ukraine, but before any potential attack. The Washington Post has the story about the controversial negotiations.

Numbers.
	•	101 million. The number of people who voted in U.S. House races.
	•	52.2 million. The number of votes for Republicans, as of 10pm EST on Sunday night.
	•	47.2 million. The number of votes for Democrats, as of 10pm EST on Sunday night.
	•	~35,000. The margin of Raphael Warnock’s (D) lead over Herschel Walker (R) in Georgia's Senate race, which is now headed to a runoff.
	•	~300,000. The margin of Gov. Brian Kemp’s (R) victory over Stacey Abrams (D) in Georgia's gubernatorial race.
	•	1934. The last time that a president's party maintained control of all the state legislatures where they previously had a majority, which Democrats did in this election.

A 14-year-old inventor in San Diego has won a prize for coming up with Finsen Headphones, which use blue light therapy to detect and treat mid-ear infections. Leanne Fan says the low-cost option can treat a problem that impacts 700 million people worldwide and causes 21,000 deaths a year. She also believes her invention could reduce post-infection hearing loss by up to 60% in children. The invention took home the top prize in the 2022 3M Young Scientist challenge.

Hey Snackers,
It’s that time of year: the National Toy Hall of Fame inducted its three newest members, including a spinning top and Masters of the Universe figurines. Honorary mentions: bingo and the piñata.
Stocks rallied majorly last week after encouraging inflation data. The Nasdaq spiked 8% as investors hoped the Fed would slow its roll on rate hikes. Cryptocurrencies plunged as the FTX drama unraveled. On Friday the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy.

VOTED
How midterms could affect the markets, from inflation to energy to cannabis
The midterm hangover… isn’t over. It’s still too close to call, but the US might get a split government, with one GOP-controlled chamber of Congress. Stocks plunged Wednesday after midterm results didn’t show clear gridlock. Investors generally prefer when power’s shared, because historically that’s meant less legislation (it’s harder to agree on things). That can mean fewer potential blockers for business, regardless of which party’s in power.
	•	Democrats maintained their slim majority in the Senate after key victories in Nevada and Arizona over the weekend. Georgia’s runoff election is slated for December 6.
	•	If Republicans take the House (which they’re favored to) that’s enough to unlock gridlock. Either way, majorities will likely be slim within both chambers.
Ballot bubbles giving SAT flashbacks… From choosing lawmakers to voting on propositions, Americans’ ballot decisions could have big implications. A few sectors that could be affected:
	•	Energy: Republican lawmakers have supported US energy independence, and that could lead to easier access to drilling permits if the GOP takes the House.
	•	Cannabis: Voters in Maryland and Missouri legalized recreational marijuana, joining 19 other states and DC. Meanwhile, Colorado voted to decriminalize and regulate some psychedelic substances (think: magic mushrooms).
	•	EVs: California voted down an extra tax to build EV infrastructure. Lyft was the biggest backer of the prop, since the funds would’ve helped it meet the state’s requirements.
	•	Gambling: CA voters also struck down a prop that would’ve allowed gambling companies like FanDuel and DraftKings to offer online sports betting.
	•	Tobacco: And CA became the largest state to ban flavored-tobacco products after voters upheld the state’s ban. Tobacco titans like Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds had spent big in hopes of overturning it.
 
THE TAKEAWAY
Investors care more about the Fed right now… Because the central bank has the levers to influence rates and inflation. Inflation was voters’ most pressing issue in these elections (two years ago it wasn’t on the radar). Markets rallied hard Thursday after news that inflation cooled more than expected last month, which suggests the Fed might slow its rate hikes (top of mind for investors).

ZOOM OUT
Stories we’re watching...
Major whiplash… Crypto exchange FTX (including FTX US and 130 affiliated companies) filed for bankruptcy Friday after a whirlwind week revealed an $8B balance-sheet hole — and rival Binance bailed on its takeover plan. Oh, and FTX halted customer withdrawals — but that didn’t stop $515M from being moved out of the exchange Friday night in a possible hack. Sam Bankman-Fried, the exchange's now former CEO, had been a Capitol Hill regular lobbying for industry-friendly regs. Now, that regulation's in doubt. Meanwhile, investors fear FTX's "contagion" could spread. One sign that it may have already: BlockFi (which got bailed out by FTX in June) suspended withdrawals, citing FTX's downfall.
Googling “packing hacks”... to avoid the $50 luggage fee. Budget airlines are booming as more travelers turn to no-frill flights to hit the inflated skies. Last week, Irish airline Ryanair reported record passengers and profits for its summer quarter. Meanwhile, US-based Frontier saw sales jump 35% as passengers paid extra for perks (think: bearable legroom). Travel is still hot: even with airfare forecast to be the priciest in five years, half of Americans plan to travel this holiday season.

EVENTS
Coming up this week...
Xi Jinping saw his shadow… and Chinese stocks may have six more weeks of winter. China’s tech giants posted their slowest growth ever in August as Beijing’s zero-Covid policy raised costs and hurt demand (because: more lockdowns). Chinese stocks popped this month on reopening rumors. But as Covid cases surged last week hawkish President Xi said he planned to “hold fast” to the strict policy (though he relaxed some rules on Friday). We’ll see how wounded giants Alibaba, JD.com, and Tencent Music are faring when they report this week.
Jingle bells in November… Retailers are getting into the holiday spirit early. Walmart’s sales jumped 8% last quarter, but profits were squeezed as inflation-fatigued shoppers avoided big-ticket items like TVs. Target’s profits fell 90% as it offered steeper discounts on overstocked goods. Still, holiday sales are expected to rise from last year, and retailers are already setting up festive displays to hype demand. But an unmerry combo of discounts and high costs could keep Walmart and Target from wowing investors when they report this week.

ICYMI
Last week's highlights...
	•	HitTok: From Sony to Universal Music, the largest record labels want a bigger cut from TikTok as the app becomes a hit-maker. While TikTok needs the music industry, the industry increasingly needs the Tok.
	•	iSag: Apple's expecting a drop in iPhone shipments this holiday season (picture: 3M fewer iPhone 14s than anticipated). Last week, China’s Covid policy triggered a weeklong shutdown at the main iPhone assembly site.
	•	Alexa: Amazon's reportedly looking to cut costs, and Alexa could get downsized. But instead of Meta-sized layoffs, Amazon is said to be pushing workers to find roles in more lucrative divisions of the company.

What else we're Snackin'
	•	Loanly: The Biden admin stopped taking applications for student-loan forgiveness after a federal judge in Texas blocked the president's plan, putting 26M applications on hold. Biden plans to fight the decision.
	•	Cooling: The once booming housing market has hit a wall. Online brokerage Redfin cut 13% of its staff last week as the housing market slides into what’s expected to be its second-worst correction since WWII.
	•	Power: It's not luck that last week's lotto jackpot ($2B) was the largest in US history. Advertised prizes are based on estimated returns for 30-year bonds, and Fed rate hikes mean those estimates have soared.

Based on your usage breakdown, here are a few tips:
  
Keep your food covered
Uncovered food releases moisture and forces your refrigerator’s compressor to work harder.

Adjust your fridge temperature settings
An ideal fridge temperature is 33°F to 39°F.

Seal the gaps!
Without a tight seal all the way around doors and windows, it’s just like leaving them open. Ensure a good seal around doors and windows by renewing weatherstripping.

Harbor 8th Ward 
Brethren,
Apologies for the late email. We look forward to meeting as a quorum for the first time in the new ward! Since we are the last ward in the building, we will be meeting for Elders Quorum in the chapel.
We invite you to review Elder Renlund's most recent talk "A Framework for Personal Revelation" and come prepared to share your thoughts/experiences. At the beginning of class, we will spend a few minutes getting to know each other better. Ministering assignments may take time, but we want to continue to strengthen relationships.
See you tomorrow!
-Elders Quorum Presidency

Greetings Bryant,
We’ve already told you a bit about how iSchool students tend to stand out among their peers from the moment they hit the job market.
Equipped with a lucrative skill set that businesses across all industries and sectors of the economy are looking for, our students go on to work with tech giants, innovative startups, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations within six months after graduation.
One way students like you are able to achieve those outcomes is through sponsored projects that closely resemble the work you’ll be doing in the real world.
From industry consulting and startup incubators to data projects and academic research, you’ll have an abundance of opportunities to add projects to your portfolio.
Some student favorites include…
	•	iConsult Collaborative
	•	C4 Lab: Computation, Communication, Complexity, and Cognition
	•	Faculty Assistant Program
	•	NEXIS
	•	SIDEARM Sports
	•	Smart Grid Research Center
And that’s just to name a few.
The iSchool is also home to nearly a dozen research centers and laboratories where you can take part in our commitment to long-term discovery and innovation in a particular area like digital literacy, emerging technology, smart grids, and more.
Our 30+ faculty work on issues ranging from machine learning and AI to blockchain, cybersecurity, and the effects of social media on elections. And when you engage with these topics in the classroom, you’ll also be learning how to use the same software and tools used by industry leaders.
Wherever your passion lies, one thing is clear — there’s a place for you at the iSchool.
Interested in learning more? Check out our research page and let us know which areas pique your interest the most! If you'd like to connect with our admissions team, faculty and current students, explore our virtual visit opportunities.
We’d love to hear from you. Hit “reply” and let us know what you want to study here at the iSchool.
Talk to you soon.
Sincerely,

Zachary Schuster Director for Graduate Admissions and Recruitment School of Information Studies  igrad@syr.edu

P.S. We’re always available for a 1-on-1 meeting to answer your questions and explore the right options for you. Make an appointment today!

HIGHS AND LOWS
 
  
Before I start on the highs and lows, I first want to give a big shout-out to veterans. We love you. Thank you so much for all that you do. 
Okay, the highs and lows: I'm here in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP27.
 
The high is that on an international platform, I had a chance to make the case for conservatives and that we can have energy independence, we can have low, affordable fuel prices, a strong economy, and we can reduce emissions. And we have the plan to do that.
 
The low I know no one's going to feel sorry for me but I had no sleep on the flight over here. So, no sleep for 24 hours. Hard to get any sympathy for that. Sharm El-Sheikh is a beautiful place, and we are sharing an important message. I hope you all have a great weekend.

Dear Bryant,
 
As you explore your options for graduate school, I do hope that you will consider applying to the Biophysics Graduate Program at the University of Notre Dame.
The Biophysics Graduate Program is a relatively new cross-departmental Ph.D. program that trains students at the boundaries between the traditional disciplines of biology, physics, chemistry and applied mathematics.
The University of Notre Dame has outstanding research facilities, including state-of-the-art instrumentation and laboratories.  Our faculty are recognized leaders in their respective fields who have dedicated their careers to guiding the development of graduate students into independent scientists.  Alumni of our graduate programs hold a broad range of positions in academia, industry and other sectors. The diversity of faculty research interests provides our students with a broad interdisciplinary background, and considerable choice and flexibility in class choices and research projects. 
The graduate stipend for the 2022/2023 academic year is $34,428 (twelve-month appointment). The Biophysics Program covers the full stipend for the first year, alleviating the need for first year students to accept teaching assistant positions. Funding in subsequent years is provided by the student’s research advisor. Tuition costs, which currently amount to about $60,044, are paid in full by the Graduate School for all students in our program. Health insurance fees are also fully covered for Biophysics graduate students.
Further details about the faculty and research clusters, as well as an online application, can be found at http://biophysics.nd.edu.Take a look at our Biophysics graduate program brochure. The deadline for applications is December 1, 2022. I invite you to apply to the program with no application fee, by using the fee waiver code, "BPHY48".  Please feel free to contact me at biophys@nd.edu if you have any questions about the Program, or our faculty if you have questions about their research interests and current projects.

Dear Bryant,
 
As you explore your options for graduate school, I do hope that you will consider applying to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at the University of Notre Dame.
The IBMS Graduate Program is a cross-departmental Ph.D. program that organizes research and training thematically and allows students to explore research interests independent of departmental boundaries.
Notre Dame has excellent research facilities, including state-of-the-art instrumentation and laboratories.  Our faculty are recognized leaders in their respective fields and appreciate the importance of providing graduate students individual attention so as to maximize their learning experience.  The diversity of faculty research interests provides our students with a broad interdisciplinary background, and considerable choice and flexibility in class choices and research projects.   Further details about the faculty and research clusters, as well as an online application, can be found at http://ibms.nd.edu. The deadline for applications is December 1, 2022. I invite you to apply to the program with no application fee, by using the fee waiver code, "IBMS31".  The current stipend for the 2022/2023 academic year is $34,428 for twelve-month appointments. The IBMS program covers the full stipend for the first year alleviating the need for first year students to accept teaching assistant positions.  Graduate fellowships are available for incoming students and we subsidize the University of Notre Dame Student Health Insurance plan. Tuition costs, which currently amount to about $60,044, are paid in full by the Graduate School for all students in our program.  If I can answer any specific questions you may have, please contact me at ibms@nd.edu. If you are interested in the research of a particular member of our faculty, please contact them directly or inform me and I will have them contact you.  Best regards,  Jeff Schorey Professor Director, Integrated Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program 129 Galvin Life Science Center University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, Indiana 46556

A more transparent and secure crypto exchange 
Hi Bryant, 
With the recent liquidity issues in the crypto markets this week, we want to reiterate how Coinbase’s business is different and ultimately better protects your account & digital assets. 
For the last 10 years, we have built Coinbase in a way that allows us to be transparent about our track record and balance sheet strength, and effectively and prudently manage risk for our 108+ million customers and ourselves. 

See below for more information about how we keep your funds safe: 
 
Healthy Financials 
Our public, audited financials confirm our financial strength and ample liquidity — we largely hold our assets in USD. We ended Q3 with $5.6 billion in total available USD resources, including $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
We hold your Assets 1:1 
Coinbase holds customer assets 1:1, and we won't lend those assets without your consent. This means funds are available to our customers at any time. 
 
Transparent 
We are the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the world, and we've been around for a long time, serving customers for over 10 years. Our financial statements are public and released quarterly. 
 
U.S. Based 
Coinbase is based and incorporated in the U.S. We are seeking to work within the U.S. system, because we believe that transparency and trust are essential. 
 
Your Funds, Your Choice 
Coinbase doesn't use, or lend, your assets without your permission. Also, we offer one of the most secure and multifaceted risk management programs designed to protect our customers' assets. This blog post details our prudent approach to risk management and how we keep our customers safe. 
 
Industry-Leading Security 
The technology that powers our platform was developed with industry-leading security and encryption at its core. Our security team is constantly working to make sure you and your assets are protected from emerging threats. Learn more. 
We are confident about the future of crypto and appreciate the opportunity to earn your trust every day. 
Sincerely,
The Coinbase Team

Team America,  
During the most divisive time ever in our history, ‘Common Ground Campus’ blazes a path toward restoring civility.  It replaces contentious debate with bridging the divide.  Powerful communication and dynamic collaboration are our key elements.   This is a revolutionary game changer for society.  
 
“Common Ground Campus” will ignite the desire, reflect value, and generate opportunity to segue as a launching pad for TPUSA student activists and chapters to ‘Bridge the Divide’ through cross branding, advertising, and promotions.
 
As part of the Common Ground experience, free swag and pizza will be provided to participants, along with a chance to be advised by contestant mentor Brent Hamachek, a best-selling author and national sales keynote speaker.  You will learn to amplify your voice letting it radiate beyond your current audience.  
 
Previous participants and audience reaction to Common Ground Campus events has been overwhelmingly positive. To summarize the response, here is what was said:
“This was amazing. I’ve never seen anything like this. This needs to happen on every college campus in the country!” 
 
WATCH Common Ground Campus’s latest video, and check out their features on Newsmax and Human Events.
 
Above is a sample promotional flier for an event that can be either printed or transmitted digitally. Any student group(s) can be inserted.
 
Businesses or individuals can help to sponsor a CGC event!
If you want to help change the world, either individually or through your company, you can make a donation through a 501(c)(3) to support their mission. Your sponsorship can help make possible:
	•	Event live streaming and basic post-production framing
	•	Event promotion
	•	Spirit merchandise for audience and participants
	•	Post-event pizza party for audience and participants
	•	Travel & other logistics/set up costs particular to the event venue Sponsor benefits can include (varies based on sponsorship level):
	•	Your name associated with the event
	•	Embedded name/company logo on video (live stream & post-produced)
	•	Name recognition for national & local press releases & coverage

Digital tidying tips from Marie Kondo 
We partnered with tidying expert Marie Kondo to help you easily organize your emails and files across Gmail and Google Drive. 

Explore Marie’s tips 
 


TIP 1

Keep a cleaner inbox

Make it a goal to address emails daily, so nothing stays in your inbox. For a fresh start, just archive all your current emails. Don’t worry, you can always find them again by searching or going to All Mail.

 



TIP 2

You only need a few folders

A few folders are really all you need to organize Google Drive. When naming your folders and files, make sure to use obvious keywords for simpler searching.

 



TIP 3

Search beyond keywords

Use the intuitive search feature in Gmail and Google Drive to find what you’re looking for. You can narrow results by date, what’s in the email or file, who sent it, and more.

 



 

Identify unwanted files

Want to clear out files you no longer need? You can use the Google One storage manager to find and remove anything that no longer sparks joy.

Every time you add a name, date, or location to your tree, we search our massive collection for records that may match. When we find a match, you get a hint. 


Each hint could be a record, a photo, or a story that can contain interesting new details you haven’t yet unearthed. These details make up the intricate tapestry of your story.

SEO tools, are useful features that help you enhance your website's organic search results and increase traffic to your website. A high ranking on organic search results will bring more traffic to your website without having to pay for ads. Here are a few tips and tools to improve your website's SEO results:  
	1.	Edit your website Meta Tags Meta tags are text designed to describe the website's content. Meta tags will appear inside the website's source code, and they function as a content description when search engines scan the web to find websites relevant to a user's search result. Meta tags are also displayed in the search results, so it is recommended for the text to be written as marketing text, to make your website stand out compared to your competitors.   
	2.	  
	3.	Include your Keywords in the Content Keywords are the topics that best define your website's content, they are the terms people enter in the search engine - called "search queries". If you summarize the content on your website into words and phrases, those would be your primary keywords. The goal of a content creator and website owner is to make sure that the keywords are as relevant as possible to what users are searching for, to get more people to find the website when searching the web.   
	4.	 
	5.	Connect a Custom Domain A custom domain name is the most important aspect in improving how visitors see your website, and it will be considered professional and reliable to your visitors if it has a custom domain. Having a professional website allows you to better connect with your users, build trust and help visitors feel safe when browsing your site. With a custom domain name, people will take your website seriously, you'll be in control of your business email addresses, and it will provide your website with a unique brand.   
	6.	 
	7.	Connect your website to Google Search Console Use Google Search Console (Google Webmaster Tools) to assess your site's SEO performance and traffic, fix issues, and submit your sitemap and URLs for fast indexing. You can even see which searches bring the most users to your website! Try it out and analyze your site's impressions, clicks, and position on Google Search.   
	8.	  Check out the SEO Advisor tool:

Subject: Reminder: HGSE Application Deadlines

Dear Bryant,
As we approach the middle of November, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of key deadlines, application requirements, and funding opportunities for the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). (Please note that this email is being sent to all prospective students, regardless of application status.) 
HGSE Application Deadlines  The upcoming application deadlines for enrollment in the 2023-2024 academic year are as follows:
	•	December 1, 2022 (5:00 p.m. EST) - Doctor of Philosophy in Education (Ph.D.) submitted to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS)
	•	December 15, 2022 (11:59 p.m. EST) - Doctor of Education Leadership (Ed.L.D.)
	•	January 5, 2023 (11:59 p.m. EST) - Master's in Education (Ed.M.)
In addition, your recommenders should complete a form and upload a letter in support of your candidacy through the online system by these dates. More information is available on the How to Apply page of our website. You can also click on the appropriate program above to set up and access your online application account.   Test Scores and Transcripts  The Admissions Office will need to receive your test scores, if required*, (e.g., GRE/GMAT, TOEFL/IELTS) by the application deadline as well. Be sure to direct your scores to the correct Admissions Office:
	•	Ph.D. applicants: institution code 3451 for GSAS
	•	Ed.L.D. and Ed.M.* applicants: institution code 3428 for HGSE *GRE scores are optional for Ed.M. applicants
Be prepared to upload copies of transcripts for each postsecondary institution you have attended as part of your online application; these are required to complete your application. Please note that transcripts should NOT be mailed at this time; only admitted students will need to provide official transcripts prior to matriculation.    Ed.M. Program Referral Option for Doctoral Applicants  If you are applying to the Ph.D. or Ed.L.D. programs and would like to be considered for a Master's (Ed.M.) program at HGSE, in the event that you are not going to be admitted to the doctoral program, please indicate this in your doctoral application. (Both applications have a specific section for this information.) Be prepared to indicate a single, specific Ed.M. program. Expressing interest in a Ed.M. possible program referral will not negatively influence the decision of the doctoral admissions committees. 
Note: Doctoral applicants do not need to submit a financial aid application. However, those who say "yes" to an Ed.M. referral are encouraged to apply for master's fellowships and funding in the event that they are admitted to the Ed.M. program. See "Funding Opportunities" below for more details.
Funding Opportunities  HGSE offers a number of Ed.M. funding opportunities, including grants, fellowships, and work-study funding. We encourage all applicants to apply for HGSE financial aid and to do so by the February 17, 2023 financial aid application deadline.
In particular, three fellowship awards available to full-time master's students are included within the admissions application: the Urban Scholars program (experienced urban educators), the Saul Zaentz Fellows program (individuals invested in early childhood education), and the Leadership in Education fellowships (candidates with strong leadership potential). The Ed.M. applicant deadline for these awards is Thursday, January 5, 2023.
Both doctoral programs provide full tuition and health fee support as well as stipends. Please visit the Financial Aid website to learn more about the doctoral funding packages, as well as the full suite of Ed.M. funding options. 
Finally, if you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to look at our Recorded Webinars for information shared in recently held events that cover individual degree programs, application tips, student life, and much more!  We look forward to reviewing your application, and we hope HGSE will be part of your plans for academic year 2023-2024.
Best,
Selma J. Abdul Interim Director of Admissions

Dear Bryant,
 
Yesterday was a landmark day in Young Americans for Liberty's (YAL) history.
 
We doubled the size of our coalition of state reps!
 
 

The current number as of this morning is 325, with a number of races still yet to be called. We'll update you again in the next few days as the info from those races comes in.

Four years ago, YAL set the audacious goal of building a coalition of 250 state reps. Last night, we blew that goal out of the water!

To make this happen, YAL students knocked on 3.8 MILLION doors through Operation Win at the Door! 

YAL students’ commitment to liberty is unmatched, and we are so proud of our many dedicated, hardworking activists.

Nationally, there wasn't the massive red tidal wave that some had predicted. Despite that, liberty candidates performed well at the state level because dedicated people put in the legwork to make it happen.

Here at YAL, we focus on the state level because we know that is where so much of the policies are made that influence our lives on a daily basis. The government overreach of the Covid-era proved that more than ever before!

Over the last 2 years, our coalition of pro-liberty state reps has passed hundreds of pro-liberty bills. In 2021, this coalition made 88 million Americans more free. In 2022, it made 91 million Americans more free.

For 2023, with our expanded coalition, we plan to make 100 million Americans in 25 states more free!

All of the results described above are possible because of a lot of teamwork from some really principled and dedicated people including YAL students, legislators, activists, supporters, staff, and more.

Together, we #makelibertywin!

Heavenly Father Knows and Loves Each One of Us
 
In the most recent Friend to Friend broadcast, President Susan H. Porter, Sister Amy A. Wright, and Sister Tracy Y. Browning of the Primary General Presidency taught that Heavenly Father knows each of His children by name and loves them very much.
 
They shared that staying on the covenant path helps us to feel Heavenly Father’s love. The two most important commandments are first to love God and second to love our neighbors. Children from around the world shared how they can show their love to Heavenly Father by helping those around them. 
 
Children were invited to take a moment to ponder and ask Heavenly Father to help them think of a way to serve others. They then wrote down or drew a picture of the idea they thought of. Find out what ideas they came up with as you watch the full broadcast with your children.

Dear Valued Customer? We are aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approaching an unknown person for establishment of project and investment but after due vetting and evaluation of your Inheritance file which the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Forwarded and contacted us to see to your immediate payment sum of US$15,000,000.00 from their offshore Account with us. 
 
We were meant to understand from our findings that you have been going through hard ways by paying a lot of charges to see to the release of your fund (US$15,000,000.00), which has been delayed by handiwork of some miscreant elements from Nigeria, so, we advise you to stop further communication with any correspondence from Nigeria as you have met up with Barclays Bank directly, although’ we knew that your representatives in Nigeria will tell you to still go ahead with him/her but on your own risk. 
 
The only thing required from you is to obtain a Non-Residential Clearance Form/Receipt which we are not asking you to pay the fee to us here in the United Kingdom as the Government of Nigeria has paid us for handling/processing your payment with other customers.

We will help you to see that you obtain the Non-Residential Clearance form without any stress so that our bank will affect immediate wire transfer of your Inheritance fund sum of (US$15,000,000.00) into your designated bank account. If you follow up our directives Barr. Emmanuel Justice instructions, your fund will reflect into your designated bank account within five Bank working days from the day you obtain your Non-Residential Clearance form.

so contact Barr. Emmanuel Justice with this Email Address below for your Non-Residential Clearance Certificate.

Subject: BYU: 4 Things to Do, 2 Things to Know

Four Things to Do. 

  
1. Prepare for Elder Peter M. Johnson's Devotional. He would like you to prepare for his devotional on November 15 by doing the following four things:
	•	Read Luke Chapter 22
	•	Read 3 Nephi Chapter 11
	•	Read President Russell M. Nelson’s October 2022 Conference Talk, “Overcome the World and Find Rest”
	•	Watch the video “Running Toward the Light”
2. Write your name on the wall if you beat the high score at PONG at the library's newest exhibit called "Latter-day Gamers." Learn about the history of Latter-day Saint games and Church members who influenced the game world. In addition to a great visual experience, pay attention to the retro music playing throughout the space, located just inside Special Collections on the first floor of the HBLL. 
3. Come see how “the world is our campus” during International Education Week. Enjoy cultural performances, international movies, lectures, giveaways, club activities, service events and more during November 14-19. Check out the full list of events at iew.byu.edu. 
4. Visit the South Pacific with us as students perform traditional dances from across Polynesia. BYU Luau is an event where students showcase the diverse heritages and traditions of Polynesian peoples through music, song and dance. 

Two Things to Know. 
1. You can win $50k with your own innovation. Are you the next Student Innovator of the Year? If you apply before December 5, you can receive up to $400 to prototype your innovation. Apply now at sioy.byu.edu. 
  
2. Academic Dates + Deadlines
	•	Discontinuance Deadline: Nov. 22
	•	2nd Term Withdraw Deadline: Nov. 22
	•	Friday Instruction: Nov. 22
	•	Thanksgiving Holiday: Nov. 24+25

One Thing to Watch. 
  
1. BYU track and field hosted the 10th annual Courageous Kids Invitational, where children with severe medical conditions ran, jumped and celebrated with BYU athletes as teammates.

Upcoming Webinar & New Podcast Episodes
 
 
Register Free 
Sexual Mindfulness - Dr. Chelom Leavitt, PhD, JD
November 15th @ 5-6pm MDT
 
Join Chelom to talk about how the simple practice of staying present in the moment and using curiosity instead of judgment can improve the connection you and your partner experience during sex. Her research has shown that couples who are mindful during sex create a better environment, feel more emotionally connected, and have better physical functioning. Learn how a few simple practices can strength your relationship and develop more meaning in your interactions.
 
Details:
 
	•	Dr. Leavitt will hold an anonymous Q&A session for the final 15-20 minutes of this 1 hour webinar
	•	This webinar is approved by the UAMFT for 1 Continuing Education Credit
	•	After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.
 
About the Presenter:
 
Chelom Eastwood Leavitt grew up in Yakima, Washington with seven sisters and one brother. She attended BYU as an undergraduate in Economics and then went to J. Reuben Clark Law School. Chelom practiced family and estate law for years and then returned to get her master’s degree in Marriage, Family, and Human Development. In 2010 Chelom was invited to be a Fulbright Fellow in Ukraine and teach in Shevchenko University in Kyiv. 
 
Chelom Leavitt received her PhD from Penn State. She is an Assistant Professor at Brigham Young University. She studies healthy sexuality in committed relationships and focuses on how mindfulness during sex may be associated with positive outcomes for both men and women. Chelom recently published in the Journal of Sex Research on how women’s sexual response cycles are more variable than the traditional models suggest and in the Journal of Sexual Medicine on the curvilinear association between women’s orgasm and sexual and relational satisfaction.

If your credit card is Not Apple Card, you’re probably stuck in the stone age of credit cards, with countless fees, confusing reward systems, and your personal info possibly up for sale. Apple Card offers something better — up to 3% Daily Cash back, no fees2 at all, and an enhanced level of privacy and security with the advanced technologies of Face ID, Touch ID, and Apple Pay. Apply in as little as a minute and see your credit limit and interest rate offer — all without impact to your credit score.

Other credit cards often charge annual fees for access to perks that you might not even use or that usually come with restrictions. But Apple Card gives you valuable benefits without annual fees. In fact, Apple Card has no fees at all.

With Daily Cash back, there are no gimmicks, no points to count, just cash back3 in your account that you can use every day. It sounds simple, because it is. Get 3% back with your Apple Card at Apple and when using Apple Pay at select merchants.* And everywhere else, you’ll get 2% back when using Apple Pay, which is accepted at 85% of merchants across the U.S.
Learn more about Daily Cash 
 
 
Apple Card gives you the option to choose interest-free4 financing on Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and more. Simply select Apple Card Monthly Installments as your payment option when you make your purchase at Apple. And you always get 3% Daily Cash up front on the full purchase price. That’s something no other credit card can offer.

Apple Card never sells your data to anyone. And the Apple-designed titanium card doesn’t even have a number on it. Other cards don’t protect your privacy like this one.

Nike: 3% Daily Cash is not available at Nike-branded stores outside of the United States. 

1. Accepting an Apple Card after your application is approved will result in a hard inquiry, which may impact your credit score. 

2. Variable APRs range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. Late or missed payments will result in additional interest accumulating toward your balance. 

3. An Apple Cash card is required to use Daily Cash, except if you do not have an Apple Cash card, in which case you can only apply your Daily Cash as a credit on your statement balance. The Apple Cash card is issued by Green Dot Bank, Member FDIC. See apple.com/apple-pay/ for more information. Daily Cash is earned on purchases after the transaction posts to your account. Actual posting times vary by merchant. Daily Cash is subject to exclusions, and additional details apply. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information. 

4. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S. to select at checkout for certain Apple products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about eligible products. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI and are subject to your card’s variable APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. iPhone activation required on iPhone purchases made at an Apple Store with one of these national carriers: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, or T-Mobile.

Hi bryantmcarthur, 
You’re now part of the world’s largest data science community. Welcome, we’re glad you’re here! 
Whether you’re new to machine learning or a renowned expert, we want to support you with powerful tools and resources to help you grow as a data scientist. 
So, where’s the best place to start? 
We highly recommend trying out our no-pressure Titanic competition. You’ll be challenged to predict which passengers survived the infamous 1912 shipwreck. 
Get Started Here 
It’s a really fun and fast way to get a strong grasp of how our platform works. You’ll become more familiar with how our Notebooks (online coding environment with no cost GPUs), open datasets, and discussion tools work together to help you build data science projects.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or an e-mail). You can find contact details in the Kaggle Terms of Use. You don’t need to give a reason for your withdrawal and your withdrawal is within the deadline if you send us the withdrawal request before the withdrawal period expires.

Reply-To: "Lauren Daugherty" <reply-fece17717265067e-113_HTML-537611373-534000302-12006@mail.yaliberty.org>

Bryant,
 
The moment is here. 

Four years ago, YAL launched Operation Win at the Door (OWD) to do what no other organization was doing: build a coalition of 250  state legislators to fight tooth and nail for liberty.

Tomorrow, when we wake up, that vision will be a reality, and we will have surpassed that number by leaps and bounds.

Thanks to YAL students, we made an enormous impact for liberty this election.
 
Through OWD, students have knocked on 
3.8 million doors across the country.
 
The election results tonight will be historic.

Tomorrow, we’ll update you on the wins. But the real results come from the legislation these legislators will promote and pass next year.

In fact, this group of legislators will be able to make 
100 MILLION Americans more free in 2023! 

YAL students helped get them elected in 2022 and YAL students are going to be helping them pass meaningful legislation in 2023.

This kind of collaborative teamwork is how YAL is able to make many millions of Americans more free EVERY year.

Stay tuned! We’ll share more info on the results and ways to get involved soon!

Thank you!
 
Lauren Daugherty
CEO
Young Americans for Liberty, Inc.

"All the amazing people on GoFundMe donated to get me a new scooter, and it’s such an amazing thing. Now I want to pay it forward. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just love you all. It means so much to me—what you people did and what I can do down the road to pay it forward."  The GoFundMe community helped Kenny raise $76,000 to provide mobility scooters to Veterans across America.

Добрый день!

Volunteer Opportunity: If you are an English speaker who also knows Russian and/or Armenian, you can help out a Ukrainian refugee family that lives in Provo, close to the BYU campus.  Contact Dr. Jennifer Bown, and she'll put you in touch with them. 

Nov. 7:30 pm: Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 performed by Utah Symphony and Andrei Korobeinikov (The Noorda Center, UVU) . Student tickets are always 50% off!
Nov. 11-12, 7:30 pm: Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 3 performed by Utah Symphony and pianist Stephen Hough (Maurice Abravanel Hall, SLC). Student tickets are always 50% off!
Nov. 11: Submission deadline for Experience: Stories Beyond the Classroom. Share your study abroad or Internship story to win $500.  Nov. 15: Application deadline for the Critical Language Scholarship. The Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program is an immersive summer opportunity for American college and university students to learn languages essential to America's engagement with the world.  Nov. 18: Application deadline for the Winter 2023 internships at the Springville Museum of Art. Winter 2023 internships will be offered with collection management, education, visitor studies, or operations focuses. Visit the museum page for more information and to apply.  Jan. 4: Submission deadline for American Comparative Literature Association (ACLA) Undergraduate Seminar "Revisiting the City." This seminar invites submissions from undergraduate students addressing the relationship between cities and aesthetic representation (in literature, visual arts, film and other medias, literary, cultural, and critical theories) in any historical period or area of the world. The annual meeting will take place in Chicago on March 16-19, 2023.  Feb. 15: Submission deadline for The National Undergraduate Literature Conference at Weber State University.  Employment opportunity: Diplomatic Language Services in the Washington, DC area are looking for Russian instructors – for both in-person in the DC area and fully online classes. The only two absolute hard requirements are: at least a BA/BS degree and a valid work permit for US-based employment. With questions, contact Kate Marden (Recruiting Manager).  Mentoring opportunity: Provo Youth Mentoring is a program that helps local Provo 6th graders with adverse backgrounds and family life by providing them with a college mentor. They are currently looking for a mentor capable of speaking Russian to help one of local students. Mentors visit the elementary school once a week and help the student in various ways––homework, friendship, encouragement, etc. Mentors can choose the time they visit the student, but it needs to be at a relatively consistent time each week and during school hours. If you are willing and interested, please email me at mentorbyu@gmail.com.

Neil,

I'm sorry you had an unpleasant experience and more sorry you felt disadvantaged by cheating peers. These are good problems for us to be aware of, and I'm glad you communicated the issue. Soon, Dr. Jarvis and I will be drafting the final, and your suggestions will be taken into account, especially concerning the ethics content and the balance of skills we will be assessing. We like your idea for an ethics question specifically.

You have been a joy to have in the class this Fall, and Dr. Jarvis and I are aware of your significant contributions. Thanks for all you do to make ACME a great culture and a great program.

Dr. Boyd

On Fri, Nov 4, 2022 at 8:45 AM Neil Thompson <neil826t@gmail.com> wrote:
Hey Dr. Jarvis and Dr. Boyd,

As you might know I have been really enjoying Volume 3 this semester and have felt like a master at the material. I have spent many extra hours in the ACME lab helping people to understand the concepts because it feels like the air I breathe. However, I did not assume the test would be easy so I ensured I could do all the practice problems and took notes on every section in the book (I know you don't recommend this but it has worked for me in every test previously). I went into the test feeling quite confident and even excited.

I was not excited upon leaving the test. I was pretty disappointed. Many of these concepts I have applied to my current job as a data scientist, but pretty much none of that was tested. I think plenty of the test questions were nit-picky, which was frustrating, but my qualm is moreso with the quantity of material that wasn't tested. We spent hours doing homework assignments involving calculating estimators and means and variance, but those skills were not tested on the exam (and in my opinion, not even tangential skills). I know you were trying to keep the test short, but it was honestly too short for a test that covers so much material. The most important skills, in my opinion, did not get tested. My suggestion is to put about 50% more material on the exam and make some of the true false into multiple choice that are more calculation based.

Lastly, the ethics question was quite problematic. I, against my bad attitude that day, did the whole 2-hour reading and came to lecture humbled and listened. My worldview changed a lot. More importantly? (sarcastic) I remember you, Dr. Jarvis, talking about your family and remember that when you mentioned your family motto I remembered that I had met one of your sons who was working in the Escape Room about 6 years ago, and your other son that served in Indiana with us. However, I don't think I'll get the only tested point about Ethics in the whole first half of the semester because my mind drew a blank when I got to that question. I felt pretty dumb, because I never would have thought to write down a family anecdote, and I remembered you saying it but I couldn't quite place it. So after the test closed I asked people if they had remembered it, and the answer was universal among all I asked, "Oh dude, I did, but only because someone reminded me like on Saturday of that and said it might be on the test". Someone even admitted to me that they hadn't gone to class that day but had heard from someone after the test opened that it might be on the test so they got it right. Ethical? Kind of ironic. My suggestion for the ethics question in future exams is in a free response format ask people to write about an example of bad ethics in math they might not have recognized before we talked about it.

Thank you for reading. I don't complain often because I really like the ACME program and think you guys do a great job. How this test went down, especially with the ethics question, seemed out of place, so I felt it warranted half an hour of my email-writing time and some of your time as well.

Where Are You Interning?

 




Most Heinz College master’s students are required to complete a 10-week, full-time internship during the summer between the first and second years. These are typically paid internships. However, scholarship funding is available for students who wish to take internships that are unpaid or low paying.  Internships present you with the chance to apply what you’ve learned in your first year to real-life situations, gain exposure to your future field, build your résumé, and make lasting professional contacts.

Hey Snackers,
Worst. Perm. Ever. Dictionary publisher HarperCollins named "permacrisis" the word of the year. A representative said it "sums up quite succinctly just how truly awful 2022 has been." Sigh.
US stocks rose on Friday, but the S&P 500 lost nearly 3.4% for the week after the Fed announced its fourth straight rate hike of 75 basis points. J. Powell’s comments suggested that a pause isn’t in the cards anytime soon. At least we got an extra hour of sleep last night?

UNGLOSS
The “lipstick effect” is fading for cosmetics giants as consumers find comfort in experiential splurges
Buying a cherry-red smile… but the outlook is more matte than glossy. Beauty titans are often shielded during economic downturns thanks to the so-called lipstick effect. In gloomy times, cash-stressed consumers can’t afford big-ticket items, so they console themselves by indulging in small luxuries (think: $38 Dior Lip Glow).
	•	$20 gloss > $200 hydrafacial: As the US economy shrank in the first quarter, lipstick sales jumped 48% from last year (2X as fast as other beauty products).
	•	Lipstuck: But now even cosmetics giants are struggling to cover up ugly economic effects.
Losing luster… Last week Estée Lauder said its quarterly makeup sales fell 10%, and it lowered its outlook on weakening demand. Rival L’Oréal reported slowing growth as its profit-puppy luxe division (think: Prada, Lancôme) underperformed. FYI: Cover Girl owner Coty reports next week. But while consumers are cutting back on makeup, spending rose more than expected in September as Americans splurged on “experiential” indulgences.
	•	Travel go-tos are booming. Airbnb reported its best quarter ever last week while Marriott joined Hilton in lifting its annual forecast. Booking’s profit more than doubled.
	•	Chains including Burger King, Starbucks, and KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum Brands had robust sales growth as Americans opened their wallets for premium items like PSLs.
	•	Big food staples like Kellogg, Pepsi, and Kraft have reported strong sales this season as consumers kept stocking Frosted Flakes and Cheetos despite price hikes. Booze big shots like Smirnoff maker Diageo have also proved resilient.
 
THE TAKEAWAY
Consumers are in “bite or flight” mode… While the economy's in stressful fight-or-flight mode, some Americans are finding solace by indulging in brand-name treats (bites) or getaways (flights). Despite broad price hikes, a lot of consumers are still shelling out for Whoppers and Airbnb glamping weekends. We might need to kiss the lipstick effect goodbye, because the seemingly “protected” categories during this downturn appear to be experience-based.

EVENTS
Coming up this week...
A whole new world… While streaming entertainment powered Disney through the pandemic, real-life entertainment is propelling growth now. Revenue for the first nine months of the year was up 28% as US parks and resorts recovered and is expected to be up 25% for the year (Disney reports tomorrow). With Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, Disney surpassed Netflix’s total subs in August but lowered its 2024 forecast for Disney+ as growth slows. If the streamer hadn’t added 9M subs last quarter, as expected, investors might be bummed despite Disney's strong overall growth.
Insert (more) coins to continue... Gaming behemoths are struggling to beat their own high scores as the pandemic video-game boom slows. In the second quarter, NBA 2K maker Take-Two Interactive and tween fave Roblox fell short of quarterly earnings expectations after reporting fewer new gamers. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s $70B purchase of Activision — which makes Call of Duty — remains stalled in a lengthy regulatory review. Analysts expect earnings to keep falling when Take-Two and Roblox report this week, but revenues are forecast to rise as in-game spending stays strong.

ZOOM OUT
Stories we’re watching...
“The future of Twitter”… Every Twitter thread last week. ICYMI: Elon Musk now runs Twitter (in his words: “the bird is freed”). Top execs have left the company and advertisers are skittish. After GM paused Twitter campaigns, ad giant IPG recommended its clients pause their spend too. Meanwhile, Elon seems focused on cutting costs and boosting non-ad revenue: On Friday, Twitter laid off half its employees, and over the weekend started rolling out an $8/month charge for blue check marks. There are many opinions about the Twitter-quisition, but only time will tell if it’ll help the embattled platform rise or sink.
Giving mixed signals… US employers added 261K jobs in October, and there are roughly two open jobs for every unemployed worker (a sign the Fed’s hikes aren’t cooling the economy enough). But job growth slowed and unemployment ticked up to 3.7%. Microsoft, Netflix, Snap, and Meta are laying off employees, and Amazon and (reportedly) Apple have frozen corporate hiring. Last week Lyft and Stripe also announced cuts. Non-tech industries may also slow: last week Ford offered buyouts to underperformers.

ICYMI
Last week's highlights...
	•	#Phygital: Ralph Lauren and Epic Games announced a Fortnite fashion collection. The collab is both physical and digital, living in closets and in Fortnite avatars. It could help the preppy retailer gain younger fans.
	•	BnBest: Airbnb is on top of the world (and can maybe rent you a yurt there). By embracing WFH trends, the rental platform posted its best quarter as consumers seek IRL experiences in an always-online world.
	•	Scored: Dick’s Sporting Goods launched a $50M venture-capital fund to invest in sports-related startups. Corporate VC is booming, with companies from Google to GE to J&J building major funds.

What else we're Snackin'
	•	Gap: An NYC pay-transparency law now requires employers who hire in the city to share salary ranges for job listings. But with broad ranges being posted, it may not help close the wage gap as intended.
	•	Subs: Social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Snap are at the mercy of advertisers' budgets, but a growing push toward subscriptions (picture: monthly fees for added features) could break Madison Avenue's grip.
	•	Funged: Reddit saw $10M+ in collectible avatar sales even as the broader NFT market tanked 97% from its January peak. One possible reason: Reddit didn't mention that the polygon-based NFTs, dubbed "Snoos," were NFTs.

Subject: Students LOVE These 2 Things About the iSchool
Date: November 5, 2022 at 6:08:37 PM MDT
To: bryant0918@gmail.com
Reply-To: igrad@syr.edu

    
Greetings Bryant,
Year after year, new students at the iSchool tell us they love two things…
First is the opportunity to take classes in other colleges. We want you to pursue your own interests and take full advantage of everything available to you as a student — Syracuse is a major research institution, after all!
So go ahead and pair your interest in data mining with business forecasting. Combine network systems and engineering. Study the impact of technology alongside a course in sociology.
Wherever your curiosity leads you, follow it.
Second, the location of Syracuse is unbeatable.
From scenic countryside, to bustling metropolis, to our vibrant campus, the City of Syracuse combines the excitement of urban life with the serenity of nature.
Need an escape? You can ski, sail, bike, run, hike, and more all within 30 minutes of campus. And when you’re ready, our legendary food, museums, music, sports, and nightlife will be here waiting for you.
Best of all, you can drive or catch a train to major cities like Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City and arrive in just a few hours.
Our students love it here, and we know you will, too. Learn more by visiting Life at the iSchool. If you'd like to connect with our admissions team, faculty and current students, explore our virtual visit opportunities.  Kind regards,
Zachary Schuster Director for Graduate Admissions and Recruitment School of Information Studies  igrad@syr.edu  P.S. We’re always available for a 1-on-1 meeting to answer your questions and explore the right options for you. Make an appointment today!

Dear Bryantleland,

I hope you are enjoying your trip or being back at home. We sent you an email recently to ask how we did on your flight from Salt Lake City (SLC) to Tucson (TUS) on November 2, 2022, and I wanted to check in to see if you had a few minutes to let us know how it went.

The full survey shouldn’t take more than five minutes and would help us know what’s important to you and where we can improve next time. In fact, at the end of survey, you may have the option to record a video to provide the full story of your experience. If you’re not interested, that’s ok – we won’t follow up on this any further. 
How likely are you to recommend Delta Air Lines® to others?

Dear Bryant,

Join us on-campus on Saturday, November 12, or virtually the week of November 14 to learn how Heinz College sets the standard for educating the next generation of global leaders with our on-campus experience. Fall Visitation will feature information sessions about our Master’s degree programs and career outcomes; you’ll experience the classroom through a faculty lecture. Additionally, you'll hear from current students to learn what life is like for them, learn about Diversity, Inclusion, Climate, and Equity at Heinz College, and much more.

Master's programs covered during Fall Visitation:
	•	Arts Management - MAM
	•	Entertainment Industry Management - MEIM
	•	Public Policy and Management - MSPPM (All Tracks)
	•	Health Care Analytics and Information Technology - MSHCA
	•	Information Systems and Management - MISM (All Tracks)
	•	Information Security Policy and Management - MSISPM
The Heinz College partners with many organizations throughout the U.S. (such as PPIA, AmeriCorps, TFA and many more) to provide scholarship and other benefits to prospective students. One benefit of membership includes a travel subsidy to attend this event. Strategic Partner members who will be attending Fall Visitation on-campus on November 12 should email Carrie Rote, crote@cmu.edu, for details about the subsidy.  Are you a Strategic Partner member? Click here for a list of our Strategic Partners.
We hope to see you soon!

David

Today's read: 7 minutes.
An interesting thing happened to me in 2020.
While the George Floyd protests spread across the U.S., I watched my social circle snap to attention and dedicate themselves to understanding police violence, racial injustice, and politics in the places where they lived. For months on end, my social media feeds were filled with posts of support, explainers, and opinions. My inbox was full of questions. My dinners out and time at the bar were dominated by explicitly political conversations — difficult, nuanced, informed discussion.
Everyone wanted to do something.
In New York, this movement was palpable. And if there was one important event to latch onto in hopes of effecting some change, it was the impending mayoral race. Local politics have long been the most effective way to improve policing and the judicial system, and New York was about to enter one of the wildest, most-watched mayoral races in recent memory, with a slew of progressives speaking the language of reform running up against a former presidential candidate (Andrew Yang) and a tough-on-crime former cop, who happened to also be Black (Eric Adams).
In New York, a city dominated by Democratic voters, the primary was — for all intents and purposes — the actual mayoral election. But when it came around, I noticed something peculiar and, frankly, shocking: Very few of my friends actually voted.
When I asked people if they had voted, the most common response I got was, "The election was today?" There were very few "I Voted" stickers in my Instagram feed, and there was very little political discussion about the race over dinners or at the bar. It was odd and confounding to me. But sadly, it is not at all unique.
It's not a secret that many Americans are cynical about the value of their votes.
Whether you track this by the percentage of registered voters or the percentage of the voting age population who actually vote, the U.S. tends to sit pretty far down the list of developed nations when it comes to voter participation rates. Some countries near the top, like Australia or Belgium, have compulsory voting (it's required by law). But most do not.
Broadly speaking, there are two buckets that voters fall into when they talk about why they don't vote: Barriers and apathy. Barriers are the structural issues that voters run into that prevent them from voting, while apathy is the lack of interest, enthusiasm, or belief that their vote matters or will change anything.
One of the most extensive examinations of these buckets came from FiveThirtyEight, which put together a survey of over 8,000 people while also tracking their voting history to understand how they participated in elections over time.
You probably know the barriers by now. Registering to vote can be cumbersome. It requires meeting deadlines, having a stable home address, sending in paperwork, (sometimes) providing identification, and paying close attention to when elections are coming. Actually voting can be difficult, too: It requires taking time off of work, or getting to a polling place before or after work. For many parents, it requires finding child care. For most voters, it requires actually getting to the polling place — sometimes via public transportation if you don't have a car — and doing it in a timely fashion.
The result is that in any given election somewhere between 35% and 60% of eligible voters never cast a ballot.
Thanks to these barriers, as FiveThirtyEight points out, the people who do vote tend to be higher income and better educated, and are more likely to be white and to identify with a specific political party. Nonvoters tend to be low-income and less educated, and are more likely to be young and lack party affiliation.
When asked about the barriers to voting, those surveyed in the FiveThirtyEight poll most often cited lines that lasted more than an hour, missing a voter registration deadline, not being able to get off work, and not being able to find or physically access their polling place (which is a major issue for Americans with disabilities).
These barriers are real, insidious, and clearly play a large role in why many people don't vote.
But the apathy bucket might be even larger. So it's the one I am going to address today.
In the FiveThirtyEight survey, nearly a quarter of the non-voters or irregular voters (i.e. they didn't vote often) mentioned the barriers above. But 31% said that they decided not to vote because they disliked the candidates, and another 26% said they decided not to vote because they thought nothing would change as a result of the election.

It's hard to blame people for this feeling. When you look at why people don't vote, the refrains are familiar:
No matter who wins, nothing will change. I didn't like any of the candidates. The system is too broken to be fixed by voting. All the candidates are the same. I wanted to vote but something came up. I don't believe in voting. Because of where I live, my vote doesn't matter. Nobody talks about issues that are important to me. I'm not sure if I can vote.
There is truth in all of this. Just 60 of the 435 congressional races in the United States were considered competitive in 2020. If you live in a state like New York or Louisiana, it can seem obvious that your vote in something like a presidential race doesn't matter. This, despite the fact that independents are now the largest political bloc in America (43%) when people are asked to self-identify (Republicans: 30% and Democrats: 24%, according to September Gallup polling).
All this is to say: I think these are legitimate gripes.
Now let me tell you why you should still vote.
For starters, most elections involve much more than just one race. If you're a liberal living in Wyoming, where Trump won 70% of the vote in 2020, it might feel pointless to go vote in a presidential race. But that election also included races in Congress, the State Legislature, and the State Supreme Court.
In 2020, for instance, there were also a huge number of ballot initiatives — single-issue “yes or no” votes — on everything from marijuana legalization to whether gig workers should be employees to raising the minimum wage to $15. These are not votes to put people in power who you may not think are going to do anything — they are literally an opportunity to, overnight, change the law in your state. Ballot initiatives, on their own, should be reason enough for you to show up at the polls in most elections. Often, those ballot initiatives are actually directly tied to the barriers we wrote about above — meaning your vote could potentially reduce the number of barriers to voting that other people face. They could also change elections, like the initiative in Alaska that implemented ranked-choice voting.
If you need any convincing your vote does count, though, you should know there were a huge number of close races for Congress. Georgia, New York and Iowa all had key races whose results were so close they took weeks after election day to finalize. And across the country, every year, there are local races that are decided by fewer than 100 votes. In fact, there have been a number of significant elections decided by a single vote. NPR has helpfully put together a list of those results here.
Assuming for a moment that the empirical evidence your vote is likely to matter is not convincing, or perhaps it really is true that your vote is unlikely to change the result of any election where you live, consider this: Politicians respond to trends.
In 2020, for instance, Democrats won the presidency, House and Senate. But what did they do for the months after the election? They spent time panicking about how many Hispanic voters they were losing. Why? Because even though they won all those elections, they saw a trend they didn't like — one that forced them to rethink their strategy.
It's important to know that in politics, it is not simply about wins and losses. It’s about electorates, strategizing, the future, and analyzing those dreadful trends. When you go to vote in an election, even if your vote doesn't produce the outcome you want, it can be part of a trend that forces your legislators to take notice. This is why Republicans worry about winning back Black voters and suburban moms and it's why Democrats worry about Hispanic voters and white men without college degrees.
The result of that worry can be actual, legitimate change. Over time, parties will change their policy platforms, where they campaign, or their stances on issues to win over certain voting blocs. Your vote, and the trend it helps produce, can inspire change in a party's platform even if it doesn't produce the electoral outcome you want.
These are all practical, tangible reasons to vote. You can incite change, inspire politicians to be more responsive, and there are almost certainly issues where your life could be impacted.
Now onto the less tangible.
Many non-voters express a belief that every politician is the same. I am not entirely sure how to shatter that cliche of a generalization, so allow me to be blunt: They are not. I have interviewed dozens of politicians. I have watched hundreds of debates. I have seen how bills are drafted and move through Congress or state houses or city councils.
Politicians are not all the same.
Some are smart, qualified, honest and motivated by sincere beliefs and a desire to serve. Some are dishonest, opportunistic, unqualified and have fewer problem-solving skills than your average American. Some have very clear ideological stances tied to capitalism or religious beliefs or the Founding Fathers. Some have equally deep ideological stances tied to equity or civil rights or progress.
As Tangle demonstrates daily, there are also two dominant ideologies in the United States: Conservative and Liberal. This duopoly is not perfect either, and I sometimes regret breaking issues down along those lines, but it exists in part because it is real. Because so many Americans hold incongruent and mixed views, the breakdown of left/right in the United States is not easy. But many elected leaders earnestly hold onto views attached to our two major political parties, and walk the line in order not to upset those parties. All politicians are not the same.
Now, let's assume for a moment that you are not buying any of this. Let's assume that at this point you're still wholly convinced your vote doesn't matter and that all politicians are the same.
Let me propose this to you: Those politicians you loathe, and that system you are deriding —they depend on your apathy. They need it to succeed. They need you to believe what you believe in order to stay in power and to maintain the status quo. Quite literally, one of the only ways you can fight them — in a tangible way — is to vote.
Like him or not, Andrew Yang actually explained why this is so important quite clearly to me during our interview last year. When discussing how politicians hold onto power, Yang said this about being an incumbent candidate in a primary race: "All I have to do is keep myself from getting primaried among the 10% to 15% most extreme people in my district and then I win! So I'll act like a little bit more of a zealot or jackass or whatever, or just duck certain questions. Our democracy is structurally broken, and most of us know it on some level and so we're checking out."
In other words, because the only people who are voting are those with super strong political beliefs — far to one side of the left-right spectrum — that's who politicians campaign to. The apathy from everyone else is a tool they use to stay in power and an incentive for them to move to the fringe. Yang's solution is to switch to open primaries and ranked-choice-voting. My solution is that you vote. In fact, I'd argue that Yang's solution is essentially impossible without mine, i.e. unless more people vote.
Finally, I'll give you the flag-loving mush: You should vote because you can.
Of all the years to reflect on this freedom we have, this one should drive it home. In Ukraine, we're watching a foreign leader who imprisons and kills his political opponents and dissidents, trying to remove the option for Ukranians to choose their own elected leaders. In Iran, protesters are dying in the streets to fight back against a regime that polices everything down to what they wear. Hong Kongers who have tried to tough out the incursion from Beijing are currently holding onto what is left of their representative democracy for dear life.
This right that we have did not come cheaply. Many people died fighting for it. Many people are currently risking their lives to come here and enjoy it. You can mock this as American exceptionalism, but it’s really the opposite — our democracy isn’t an exception to the rule. If we stop participating in it, it dies. We are currently in a raucous, dangerous place, where many voters don’t believe election outcomes and gerrymandering has become a legitimate crisis.
That’s all the more reason to participate.
Anyone reading this who lives in a democratic country where you still get to pick your leaders should feel immense gratitude. Choosing our elected representatives is a gift, like being born into a family with financial stability or being born with a healthy, functioning body. Do not waste it in the name of apathy — seize it, make it better.
On November eighth, four days from now, states across the country will be holding their 2022 midterm elections. Over 30 million people have already voted. If you’re not sure what is happening in your state, this website is a helpful resource.
As you probably know by now, I don't care who you vote for. But I do care — and hope deeply — that more and more people participate in our democratic process.
So, if you haven't yet, consider this my plea for you to join the fray. 
Please: Go vote.

Earn 3.75% interest, 23x* the national average savings rate
Hi Bryant,
Now you can earn an increased 3.75% interest on your uninvested cash. Just $5 a month with Robinhood Gold.
Try Gold
By the way, there’s no cap. Your money in the brokerage cash sweep program is FDIC-insured at program banks up to $1.5 million. You can invest or withdraw your cash at any time. You can also instantly transfer funds from your brokerage account for use with a Cash Card (learn more about the Cash Card here) by creating a spending account.
Gold also gives you advanced market data and research tools, larger Instant Deposits, and optional margin lending** (if eligible). Gold is free for the first 30 days, and then $5 a month.

*As of October 19, 2022 based on data from Bankrate. Bankrate obtains rate information from the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 10 large U.S. markets. Savings account interest rates vary from bank to bank and may be lower or higher than the stated average.
**For margin enabled customers, to earn interest through the cash sweep program, a cash balance is needed. If you have a margin balance, there is no cash balance to earn interest.
All investments involve risk and loss of principal is possible.
The brokerage cash sweep program is an added feature to your Robinhood Financial LLC brokerage account. Robinhood Gold is offered through Robinhood Financial LLC.
Interest is earned on uninvested cash swept from your brokerage account to program banks. Program banks pay interest on your swept cash, minus any fees paid to Robinhood. As of November 4, 2022, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that you will receive is 1.5%, or 3.75% for Gold customers. The APY might change at any time at the program banks' or Robinhood’s discretion. Additionally, any fees Robinhood receives may vary and is subject to change. Neither Robinhood Financial LLC nor any of its affiliates are banks.
With the brokerage cash sweep program, the uninvested cash in your brokerage account (cash intended for investing but that you have not yet invested or spent) is swept to program banks (there are currently six banks in the program), where it becomes eligible for FDIC insurance up to $1.5 million or $250,000 per program bank, inclusive of any other deposits you may already hold at the bank in the same ownership capacity which may impact how much is covered. Robinhood is not responsible for monitoring the amount of your deposits in any program bank, whether these deposits are made through the brokerage cash sweep program or otherwise, to determine whether the amount on deposit exceeds the limit of available FDIC insurance. Please note that until funds are swept to a program bank, they are held in your brokerage account which is protected by SIPC. Once funds are swept to a program bank, they are no longer held in your brokerage account and are not protected by SIPC. However, these funds are eligible for FDIC insurance through the Program Banks subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. Please see the IND Sweep Agreement for more information on how the sweep program works and how we treat your uninvested cash balance.
Member of SIPC, which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). Explanatory brochure available upon request or atwww.sipc.org.
Robinhood Financial LLC (member SIPC) is a registered broker dealer.  Robinhood Securities, LLC (member SIPC) is a registered broker dealer and provides brokerage clearing services.

You can register online here, or stop by the front desk tonight and we can get you taken care of.

Subject: Don’t just learn about technology leadership. Do it.

 Dear Bryant,  There is no substitute for meaningful hands-on learning experiences. Heinz College’s Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program puts an emphasis on experiential learning, bridging learned theories and best practices.  Not only do these opportunities crystallize concepts and strategies learned in coursework, they add highly marketable industry experience to your résumé prior to graduation. In fact, 99% of MISM graduates have full-time job offers within three months of graduating—more than 75% secure an offer prior to graduation.  

CAPSTONE PROJECTS
Heinz College MISM students complete a team-based project, working in close collaboration with a real-world industry client. These projects fulfill an actual business or operational need for our partners, giving you the chance to have a measurable impact on an organization while navigating the dynamic process of devising and implementing a technical solution.  

INTERNSHIPS
Most MISM students are required to complete a 10-week, full-time internship during the summer between the first and second years. Internships allow you to apply what you’ve learned in your first year to real-life situations, gain exposure to your future field, build your résumé, and make lasting professional contacts. Most Heinz College summer internships are paid; those that are unpaid are subsidized by scholarships through our Internship Opportunity Fund.  

EXPERIENTIAL CLASSES
Many classes focus on experiential projects. For example, if you enroll in Measuring Social, you will learn to analyze social media data and solve problems for a partner organization from industry, government, and the media. Another example is Technology Consulting in the Community, in which you would be paired up with community-based non-profit in Pittsburgh, collaborating with the client to solve an IT problem for their organization. Many other courses feature practical elements as well.  

Experiential learning is a cornerstone of your CMU education.

Learn more about how ideas become action in the MISM program >

Lift tickets will be limited this season 
Don’t forget! Our resorts are limiting lift tickets every day throughout the 2022/23 winter season to prioritize your on-mountain experience. Please note, some resorts already have sold out dates where lift tickets are no longer available to purchase, online or at ticket windows.
If you know you’ll ski and ride this season, don’t wait to buy lift tickets! Lock in your access with an Epic Pass, which offers season-long access for an unbeatable value, or check out the Epic Day Pass. Epic Day Pass allows you to purchase the number of days you want to visit, from 1-7 days, and provides up to 65% savings compared to lift ticket prices.
Now is the best time to purchase, before pass prices go up November 20. Epic Pass and Epic Day Pass are non-refundable, except as provided in Epic Coverage.
We hope to see you on the slopes!

BIG BIRD 
What Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover could mean for crypto
Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter closed less than a week ago, but a myriad of potential changes are already being considered, including reviving the beloved short-form video app Vine, and charging a monthly fee to maintain blue-checkmark status (Stephen King is not a fan of that idea). And as Musk contemplates ways to juice Twitter’s revenue, many of crypto’s biggest luminaries have his ear — including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Andreessen Horowtiz partner Sriram Krishnan, and major crypto investor David Sacks. Twitter is already one of the most crypto-forward social media platforms, so Musk’s leadership has the crypto industry curious about the site’s web3 potential. Let’s take a closer look.
Twitter is already a key social platform for the crypto community, and it has experimented with NFT initiatives and crypto “tipping.”
	•	Twitter has seen more than 1 billion tweets about crypto since 2020, according to the company. Leading topics include Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, and Dogecoin (Musk’s favorite memecoin, which has rallied over 100% amid the takeover news).
	•	Last week, the company announced “NFT Tweet Tiles,” a new feature that will allow users to buy and sell NFTs via tweets — in partnership with marketplaces like Rarible, Dapper Labs, and Magic Eden. In January, Twitter released NFT verification, allowing users to display their NFTs as hexagonally cropped profile photos that include on-chain data.
	•	Twitter also made forays into blockchain-based payments in April. In partnership with the payment processor Stripe, Twitter allows creators in more than 70 countries to receive payments in the USDC stablecoin for their Super Follows or paid Twitter Spaces. The platform also allows users to “tip” their favorite creators via Bitcoin in the U.S. and El Salvador.

So, what are some of Elon’s plans for Twitter?
	•	On Tuesday, Musk tweeted that he’d like to charge $8 a month for users to receive verification, which would grant them priority placement in replies and searches, less ads, and the ability to bypass paywalls for some publishers that opt-in. 
	•	At his first all-hands meeting in front of company employees over the summer, he said that he believes crypto payments on Twitter would help to “maximize the usefulness” of the platform. Musk has also mused about making Dogecoin an official payment method.
	•	Binance’s Changpeng Zhao invested $500 million into Musk’s takeover bid to help “bring Twitter into web3 when they’re ready.” Zhao mentioned the possibility of “charging for memberships. That can be done very easily, globally, using cryptocurrencies.” 
	•	He also said Musk has frequently mentioned plans to create a “super app,” akin to China’s WeChat, which is a social media platform, payments app, and messaging service with 1.3 billion users. Payments with supported cryptocurrencies would potentially expand Twitter’s appeal globally as its users are largely concentrated in the U.S.

Why it matters… Elon Musk’s Twitter isn’t the only web2 giant that’s doubling down on crypto and blockchain tech. Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook have all launched NFT initiatives recently (with varying degrees of success.) And the developers of Aave, a popular DeFi exchange, also created Lens Protocol, a decentralized social media platform built on Polygon’s blockchain, where users create NFT-based profiles that "contain the history of all posts, mirrors, comments, and other content you generate.” No matter which platforms ultimately lead the charge on crypto innovation, we can at least be sure where we’ll hear the news first: Twitter.

TAKES 
SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce critiques her agency’s crypto approach, and key quotes from the week
Piercing remarks… In a new interview with Decrypt, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce told the publication that she is critical of how her agency has approached crypto regulation to date, “because we haven’t taken … steps to work in good faith.” Peirce went on to describe the communication problems between the SEC and the crypto industry at large. “Nobody else is in the room. The customers aren’t in the room. And the regulator has the leverage because the regulator’s about to bring enforcement action. It’s just not a good way of regulating.”
Crypto vs. gold… Last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin broke down his crypto > gold argument after cartoonist Zach Weinersmith asked why people who are wary of a centralized authority for money don’t just “go with gold?” In response, Buterin tweeted, “Gold is incredibly inconvenient. It’s difficult to use, particularly when transacting with untrusted parties. It doesn’t support safe storage options … At this point, gold has less adoption than crypto, so crypto is the better bet.”
London calling… The U.K.’s new Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, who had a career in finance before entering politics, previously expressed pro-crypto sentiments, including his intention to make the U.K. “the jurisdiction of choice for crypto and blockchain technology.” In response to Sunak’s crypto stance, one fintech founder told CNBC, “The feeling among entrepreneurs is one of relief. There’s a feeling that we finally have someone sensible in Number 10.”


 
NUMBERS TO KNOW 
$3.7 billion
The amount the Meta’s Reality Labs business — the division that oversees metaverse related tech like Oculus VR headsets — reported losing in the third quarter of 2022, up from its $2.8 billion loss in Q2. Despite last week being the worst ever for Meta’s stock since the company’s IPO in 2012, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remained committed to his bet on the metaverse, calling it “fundamentally important to the future.”

$13 million
The amount that poured into NFT project Art Gobblers just two hours after launching on Monday. A collaboration between Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland and crypto VC firm Paradigm, Art Gobblers aims to incentivize art-making with a crypto game that involves Gobbler NFTs, a lo-fi drawing tool, and something called “GOO tokens.”

40,000
Number of words in Bloomberg Businessweek’s massive cover story, “The Crypto Story,” written by finance journalist Matt Levine. An exhaustive yet entertaining read, the four-chapter opus promises to explain the biggest questions about crypto: “Where it came from, what it all means, and why it still matters.”

58%
The percentage of institutional investors that reported investing in digital assets during the first half of 2022, according to a new survey from Fidelity. This marks a six-percent increase from the same period last year, despite market turbulence. Crypto ownership was highest among respondents in Asia (69%), followed by Europe (67%), and the U.S. (42%).

The attack on Paul Pelosi.
BY ISAAC SAUL – 02 NOV 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”

Today's read: 12 minutes.
🚨
The attack on Paul Pelosi and an important story about 2024. Plus, some quick hits that include updates on elections abroad.

Quick hits.
	1.	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro broke his silence on losing the election Tuesday, saying his administration has agreed to begin the presidential transition to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but without conceding his loss. (The election) 
	2.	Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears primed to win a narrow majority in Israel's fifth election since 2019. (The results)
	3.	A member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has called on Congress to ban TikTok, citing concerns over the app exposing Americans' data to Chinese companies. (The suggestion) 
	4.	U.S. job openings grew from 10.3 million in August to 10.7 million in September, according to the Labor Department. (The rise) 
	5.	The Supreme Court declined Sen. Lindsey Graham's (R-SC) request for a stay to avoid testifying in Georgia's election interference case. (The denial)

Paul Pelosi. On Friday, reports broke that Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, had been assaulted in their home. The Pelosis live in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.
According to a Department of Justice filing on Monday, Pelosi was at home when he awoke to an intruder inside his bedroom. The man, identified by police as 42-year-old David DePape, told officers that he broke through a glass door in the home with a hammer. He asked Pelosi to wake up, and informed him that he was "looking for Nancy," to which Paul Pelosi replied that she wasn't there (the House Speaker was not home during the break-in). DePape responded that he would sit and wait for her.
Pelosi tried to access a phone in the home's elevator to call 911, but DePape stopped him. Pelosi eventually called 911 from the bathroom and left the line open so the dispatcher could hear their conversation. That dispatcher eventually sent officers to their home. DePape later told police that he felt he had to "respond" to Pelosi calling 911, since there was “no way the police were going to forget about the call.”
When police arrived at the door at 2:31 a.m., they found Pelosi and DePape struggling over a hammer. Officers asked the men what was happening, to which DePape responded "everything’s good." When police instructed them to drop the hammer, DePape allegedly pulled it from Pelosi's grip and struck him in the head with it, knocking him unconscious. Pelosi is recovering in the hospital with a fractured skull that required surgery and injuries to his hands.
Police say the attack was politically motivated, and DePape is being charged with attempted kidnapping and assault on an immediate family member of a federal official. In interviews with police, DePape said he planned "to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her,” and would "let her go" if she told the “truth.” But if she “lied,” he planned to break “her kneecaps” so she would have to be wheeled into Congress. He described Pelosi as the "leader of the pack of lies told by the Democratic Party." Police recovered zip ties, cash, a roll of tape, a hammer, white rope, and a pair of rubber and cloth gloves from DePape and the home.
When the initial news of the attack broke, there were several inaccurate reports that led to viral conspiracy theories. Several articles, including a Politico story, suggested an "unknown" person had opened the door, which many interpreted as a third person, though police later clarified nobody else was present. A local reporter said the attacker was "in his underwear" when police arrived, but later retracted that detail (Pelosi was in his underwear as he slept, and a security guard for a neighbor's home reported seeing a man in all black with a book bag approach the house).
When Pelosi called 911, he told the dispatcher “he doesn’t know who the male [DePape] is, but he advised that his name is David and that he is a friend." Pelosi was reporting to 911 that DePape was claiming to be a friend of Pelosi's, but this led some commentators to allege that Pelosi knew the attacker, which police have said definitively was not true.
Ultimately, those rumors culminated in the spread of a story from an unreliable news source called the Santa Monica Observer, which was shared in a now-deleted tweet from new Twitter CEO Elon Musk, that purported the attack was actually a drunken fight between Pelosi and a male prostitute. Several conservative commentators, including Donald Trump Jr., repeated this theory.
According to DePape's most recent employer, he had evolved from a longtime Green Party voter to someone who had become immersed in right-wing conspiracies online, including ones that frame Pelosi as an enemy of the country. DePape's social media feed is full of allegations that the 2020 election was stolen, that teachers are grooming children to be trans, and that the Jews were never actually gassed at Auschwitz. According to police, DePape was clear he was targeting Pelosi because she was second in line for the presidency.
Others have pointed to DePape's history of mental illness, which has been documented in several news reports. His former partner and mother of his children, who is currently imprisoned, has purported that he has "been mentally ill for a long time" and once disappeared for an entire year before re-emerging and claiming to be Jesus.
It's not the first time Nancy Pelosi has been the subject of death threats. In the last year, three men have been sentenced to prison for threats against Pelosi. Capitol Police installed cameras around Pelosi's house eight years ago, which captured the break-in on tape, but her security detail had left the residence with her when she traveled from San Francisco to D.C. in the days before the attack.
This incident is not the only recent case of politically motivated violence. In June, a California man drove across the country to the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh with zip ties and a gun, before confessing to police he was considering killing him. In 2017, a Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire on a Congressional baseball game, wounding Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA). He has been charged with attempted murder. Meanwhile, the U.S. Capitol Police have recorded a drastic rise in threat cases — up 144% since 2017.
Today, we're going to look at some commentary about the attack, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left says the attack is a scary reminder of the power of right-wing conspiracies and rhetoric.
	•	Many point to rhetoric of prominent conservatives who downplay or even encourage violence.
	•	Some argue that it is Republicans' reaction to the attack that is truly distressing.
In The Guardian, Jill Filipovic said this should cause a national reckoning, but instead it has just exposed indecency from the Trumpist right.
"Threatening and menacing Democrats has become a staple not just of conservative big mouths on YouTube and talk radio, but of Republicans seeking office. Trump, notoriously, used his rallies to encourage supporters to chant 'lock her up' about Hillary Clinton. Republican representative Paul Gosar tweeted a bizarre cartoon video of him killing the Democrat representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatening President Biden; he refused to apologize for it, and his actions were not broadly condemned on the right," Filipovic said. "The Republican representative from Georgia Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that Pelosi has committed treason, a crime 'punishable by death.' The Minnesota Republican representative Tom Emmer tweeted a video of himself shooting a gun, along with the words 'Exercising my Second Amendment rights' and the hashtag #FirePelosi.
"Blake Masters, a Republican who is running for a Senate seat in Arizona, has published campaign ads in which he is holding guns (in one of the ads, he specifies: 'It wasn’t designed for hunting – this is designed to kill people') and has said that when it comes to what he believes is a war between left and right, 'You can recite an eloquent poem about pacifism right before they line you up against the wall and shoot you.'... And finally, there is the rightwing conspiracy-mongering that predictably draws in those who are untethered to reality, and the related rhetoric that makes fixing the invented problem a kind of life-and-death battle of good versus evil," she wrote.
In CNN, Kara Alaimo stressed that this was not an isolated incident.
"This shocking episode is just the latest in a series of escalating attacks and confrontations against politicians, and women politicians in particular – many of whom face unacceptable hatred on the Internet that spills over into physical threats or violence. Social media platforms and law enforcement must act now to stop this abuse before a politician is gravely injured or killed. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has been harassed by a man who showed up repeatedly outside her home, armed with a handgun. Jayapal’s husband said he heard the voices of two men shouting obscenities and suggesting that they would stop harassing her neighborhood if she killed herself... Last year, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said her home was vandalized with profane graffiti.
"And Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York receives so many threats that she has a round-the-clock security team and, at times, sleeps in different locations," Alaimo noted. "Her own colleague, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, tweeted an altered anime video of himself appearing to kill her last year. (Gosar deleted the video and did not apologize. An hour after the House voted to censure him and remove him from two committee assignments last year, he retweeted a tweet that included the video.) Earlier this week, the New York Post said they fired a rogue employee who changed the headline of an online editorial to read, 'We must assassinate AOC for America.' ... The harassment, hate and violence must stop."
In The Sacramento Bee, Melinda Henneberger said Trumpers "couldn't even muster thoughts and prayers."
"We’ve reached that point in the devolution of what used to be considered common decency when even thoughts and prayers are too much to expect," she said. "The suspect, David DePape, spewed antisemitism and racism, repeated Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and in an August post that DePape’s daughter confirmed to the Los Angeles Times had been written by him, said, 'Either Q is Trump himself or Q is the deepstate moles within Trumps inner circle.' Donald Trump has weighed in on any number of topics since Mr. Pelosi was pummeled with a hammer and had to be rushed into surgery...But here’s what he said about Paul Pelosi: Nothing, of course.
"The former president’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., made his lack of empathy even clearer, retweeting a photo of underwear and a hammer, captioned, ‘Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready.’ That the son of an American president could respond so callously to violence against the husband of a Speaker of the House is stunning even now," she wrote. "When I moved to Washington in 1995, more than a few members of Congress and their families still socialized across the aisle. That some current lawmakers, like Ohio Rep. Mike Loychik, who tweeted, 'I hope San Francisco dispatched their very best social worker to respond to the brutal assault of Nancy Pelosi’s husband,' now see a politically motivated attack on the speaker’s spouse as too delicious not to make light of would have shamed many in the pre-Trump GOP. But then, as even those who can’t stop tittering will tell you, that party doesn’t exist anymore."

What the right is saying.
	•	Many on the right condemn the attack, but argue that Democrats are using it to silence criticism of their politics.
	•	Some point to the many incidents against a wide range of politicians that demonstrate the frightening nature of this moment.
	•	Others question whether DePape was a right-wing extremist with a clear political agenda.
In The Federalist, David Harsanyi said blaming conservatives for the attack on Paul Pelosi is an effort to chill speech.
"The left’s insistence that every conservative personally 'condemn' the actions of the mentally ill man who attacked Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul has nothing to do with lowering the rhetorical temperature or averting violence, and everything to do with trying to compel Republicans to take responsibility for the incident," he wrote. "Take The Washington Post, which ran a triple-bylined, reported piece headlined, 'Attack on Nancy Pelosi’s husband follows years of GOP demonizing her.' 'Years of vilification,' contend the authors, have 'culminated' in Pelosi’s husband being attacked with a hammer. By 'demonizing,' the Post means that Republicans run lots of political ads targeting perhaps the most powerful, partisan leader in the nation.
"Pelosi is demonized in the same manner Mitch McConnell or Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis are demonized. Remember ads depicted Paul Ryan pushing grandmas off cliffs? Is it that kind of demonizing?" Harsanyi asked. "All three of the 'reporters' involved in writing the Washington Post piece know full well that the person accused of attacking Pelosi with a hammer was mentally unstable, his brain, according to the mother of his children, addled by long-term drug use. This is a former pro-nudist activist, convinced that 'he was Jesus for a year,' who lived in a bus on a semi-commune and has embraced conspiracy theories from the left and right. Even if he wasn’t unstable, of course, it doesn’t mean the GOP has any responsibility to stop pointing out that Pelosi’s policy ideas are bad for the country.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board called it "another sickening example" of political violence in our disturbed culture.
"Mrs. Pelosi was fortunately in Washington at the time. Her office said her husband, who was hospitalized with head and body trauma, 'is expected to make a full recovery.' The assailant’s motives weren’t clear by the time of publication, but he seems to have been caught up like many others in conspiracy theories spun on the internet," the board said. "Mr. DePape posted links regarding right-wing election claims and he called the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of killing George Floyd, a 'modern lynching.' He also sold hemp bracelets with peace signs and posted rants about Jesus being the antichrist. In other words, he fits the profile of an alienated, perhaps mentally ill, person who latches on to internet obsessions, some of which turn out to be political.
"The U.S. is full of such people, and their political targets are on the left and right, Democrats and Republicans," they added. "The gunman who nearly killed GOP House whip Steve Scalise in 2017 at a Congressional baseball practice was a Bernie Sanders supporter. The man with weapons and ill-intent arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home this year was angry about the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade... More security will have to be provided to public officials, and candidates will have to take precautions. The growing risks will deter many people from considering politics. The political and media classes can help by avoiding hateful rhetoric aimed at their opponents."
On Fox News, Tucker Carlson said the police called to the scene should release the body camera footage for the public.
"That's often done immediately in cases like this, cases that attract heavy public scrutiny. Transparency restores the public's faith in the system. It is the only thing that does. In fact, that's the whole point of body cams, to reassure people that they can really know what happened," he said. "Transparency is the antidote to 'misinformation.' On the other hand, if you want people to fall headfirst into crazed conspiracy theories, then you would keep lying and hiding things and yet for some reason, the San Francisco Police Department is refusing to release Friday's body cam video. We learned that today when we filed a records request. No chance, they said.
"Apparently, DePape was camping full-time in a dilapidated Ken-Kesey-style school bus, complete with a gay pride flag out front and a sign that reads 'Berkeley Stands Against Hate.' Behind the bus hangs a BLM banner," he noted. "Today, Fox's Bill Melugin learned that DePape, who was originally from Canada, has long overstayed his visa, so he is currently in this country illegally. So, to restate, the perpetrator in this violent crime against Paul Pelosi is a mentally ill, drug addicted illegal alien nudist who takes hallucinogens and lives in a hippie school bus in Berkeley with a BLM banner and a pride flag out front. Take those uncontested facts and let them rattle around your brain for a moment until a recognizable pattern emerges. What does this sound like to you? If you guessed, this is obviously a textbook case of homegrown right-wing extremism, well, then, obviously, you've been watching a lot of cable news today."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	This is a really horrifying episode, and a scary time in politics.
	•	It's clear there were political motivations at play. 
	•	Many conservatives response to this has ranged from gross to insufficient.
We should first just note how horrifying this all is. An 82-year-old man was bludgeoned in the head with a hammer inside his own home because he is married to the Speaker of the House. It's fortunate Nancy Pelosi wasn't there, sure. Given what DePape said his plans were, a kidnapping or torture seems to have been likely. But if she had been there, the house almost certainly would have been surrounded by more security and this entire ordeal may not have actually happened. I have criticized Pelosi and her husband (over stock trading, political rhetoric and public policy) in the pages of this newsletter, so let me just say unequivocally that I wish him a speedy recovery and wish them both well.
The debate about whether the attack on Paul Pelosi was politically motivated or the result of a mental health crisis is a silly binary to set up. DePape was very obviously politically motivated: He wanted to hold the Speaker of the House hostage, he wanted to break her kneecaps to teach her a lesson about lying, and he decided to smash in her 82-year-old husband's skull with a hammer in front of police when he couldn't get to her. His social media posts are a litany of political conspiracies from the right. His boss, who was employing him up until a week before the attack, said "he really believed in the whole MAGA, ‘Pizzagate,’ stolen election — you know, all of it, all the way down the line."
His "political leanings," if you want to call them that, are also clearly not simple. He was a longtime Green Party voter who evidently lived in some kind of encampment featuring Black Lives Matter and gay pride flags. It may be a fool's errand to try to suss out any clear political ideology. But we can say pretty confidently based on interviews with his family, friends and employers, along with his social media feed, that he seemed totally taken by far-right conspiracies in the last year. That's about as far as we can go, and that's enough to be reminded that such conspiracies are actually dangerous in the real world.
It's also clear he had some mental health and drug issues. Reports of delusional behavior and erratic actions were common among the people interviewed. There's no need to deny this fact. Often, political violence happens when mental health issues intersect with the worst of our political rhetoric. That we haven't yet learned that, or can't simply state it, is unendingly frustrating to me.
What we can also say with confidence is that the response from prominent conservatives has been disgusting. There were condemnations, sure. But they weren’t nearly as widespread or unanimous as they should have been, and many prominent people on the right took the opposite route. Trump Jr's "joke" tells me all I need to know about him, and fits a pattern of his childish and deranged behavior (and yes, it is deranged to joke about someone who was just violently beaten with a hammer). We have normalized the absurdity and indecency so much that it hardly makes the splash it used to. But imagine for a moment if Mitch McConnell's wife were bludgeoned with a hammer (I will repeat it until it sinks in) during a home invasion and Sasha Obama tweeted out her "Halloween costume" mocking the attack. Really imagine it. That is how you should feel if you are a conservative watching this unfold.
Kari Lake, running for governor in Arizona, quipped that "apparently" Nancy Pelosi's house "doesn't have a lot of protection." She got some good laughs at her campaign event for that one. Hours after the attack was reported, Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin said violence was unacceptable, but used the story as a punchline to say voters were going to send Pelosi home to her husband. Charlie Kirk, one of the most influential and widely listened to conservatives in the country, suggested to his fans that someone bail DePape out of prison so we could get the real story. These are not random jerks on Twitter. They’re some of the most recognizable faces in today’s right-wing political world.
Many of the early reports that came out around this story were wrong, misleading, or inaccurate. Online, many conservatives used that to stir up conspiracy theories and nonsense — deflecting from the reality that political rhetoric about Democrats in Congress sex trafficking children or stealing elections will lead some people to violence. Republicans are not alone in sensationalist, elevated political rhetoric. But they have been relying on it a lot more in the last three campaign cycles, with advertisements and comments that would have been unthinkable just a few short years ago. It’s not partisan hackery to point this out.
As I said after the Buffalo shooting and the Kavanaugh threats, political commentators are not responsible for the actions of others. Nancy Pelosi called Trump's tax cuts a moment of "life and death," and "the end of the world," and even "Armageddon." I wouldn't blame her if that rhetoric resulted in threats on Trump's life at the time. But I also wouldn't absolve her of overreaching in a dangerous way.
Short of what we try to do in Tangle, I don't have a great solution for getting people to step back off the cliff’s edge. But we are in desperate need of course-correction. We have to reject politicians and political influencers who traffic in conspiracies, intentionally inflame their audiences with lies, and use language that can predictably lead to violence. We should expect more from our leaders. If we don't, we'll only keep getting more of the harrowing incidents we’ve seen in the last five years.

Under the radar.
For all the noise about what is coming in 2024, one option appears to be increasingly likely: a Trump vs. Biden rerun. The Washington Post reported this week that Biden is "quietly but clearly" preparing for a reelection bid. He and Jill Biden have been meeting with senior advisers to prepare a campaign, and senior advisers during his 2020 campaign have been involved in talks. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that Trump is preparing for a post-midterm launch. "I'm like 95% he's going to run," Reince Priebus, Trump's former White House chief of staff, told AP News. You can read The Washington Post's story here and The Associated Press's story here.

Numbers.
	•	3,839. The number of documented "concerning statements and threats" toward members of Congress in 2017.
	•	9,625. The number in 2021.
	•	7. The number of days until election day.
	•	10. The number of House races where Cook Political Report’s ratings moved toward Republicans.
	•	53%.  Following their most recent simulations, the likelihood Five Thirty Eight gives for Republicans to control a majority of the Senate.

Have a nice day. 
Neighborhoods all over America are being taken over by "bike buses." Many families are ditching cars for adult-lead bike groups, giving kids an opportunity to get outside and get some exercise first thing in the morning. The effort is simultaneously a call to combat climate change by limiting the use of vehicles for parents and students who can bike to school. Parents involved in the bike buses say the event just seems to make parents and kids happier, and in some neighborhoods people line up on their front porches in the morning and cheer the kids on. Good Morning America has the story.

Conditions of Carriage

Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example: 

• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.
• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.
• Our right to change terms of the contract.
• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.
• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.
• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight. 

Advice To Passengers On Limitations Of Liability

For international travel to or from another country, airline liability is governed by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention. There are no financial limits for death or bodily injury, and the airline may make an advance payment to cover immediate economic needs. The airline's liability for passenger delay, and for loss, delay or damage to baggage may be limited by the Conventions. In case of baggage, the liability limit is 1131 Special Drawing Rights (approximately US $1787) per passenger for international travel. The baggage limit is US $3,500 per ticketed passenger for US domestic travel. These baggage liability limitations apply unless you declare a higher valuation and pay additional charges at check-in. In case of international travel, any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of the actual or scheduled arrival of the aircraft; and, in case of baggage claims, written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in case of damage, and, in case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of the passenger. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.

Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:

If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (www.delta.com/appr) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.

Si l’embarquement vous est refusé, ou si votre vol est annulé ou retardé d’au moins deux heures ou si vos bagages sont perdus ou endommagés, vous pourriez avoir droit au titre du Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens, à certains avantages au titre des normes de traitement applicables et à une indemnité.

Use the links below to pick the date that best fits your schedule. Please remember that space is limited, so we ask that you only sign up for one of the available sessions.

If you can’t make it to campus, check out some of our upcoming virtual events including:
	•	November 2: The MBAn Student Experience
	•	November 7: MBAn & MFin Virtual Networking with Current Students

Elon Musk takes over Twitter.

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 14 minutes. 
🐦
We're breaking down the Elon takeover of Twitter. Plus, a question about "grassroots" movements and an important reader survey about a potential new product. 

Tangle Light?
One of the common refrains I get from readers who unsubscribe from Tangle is that they find the newsletter too long. My team is exploring the idea of creating a second newsletter that is a heavily abbreviated version of this one, with an option to click into the main stories you want to see.
In past reader polls, about 80% of readers have said the length of Tangle is perfect, so this newsletter will always exist as it does now. I think we need the space to add the nuance necessary for a great product. But the idea of a shorter version that is attractive to a subset of readers is interesting, too. Before we go to work on building it, I'm curious to see if there is demand for this.
Would this be something you are interested in? Take today's reader survey to let us know.

Quick hits. 
	1.	Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on affirmative action in higher education. The court appears primed to end the policy of race-based admissions in colleges. (The arguments)
	2.	The Justice Department charged David Wayne DePape with attempted kidnapping and assault after he allegedly broke into Nancy Pelosi's residence and assaulted her husband. DePape told police he planned to hold Pelosi hostage to talk to her. (The charges)
	3.	Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked a House committee from accessing Donald Trump’s tax returns. (The ruling)
	4.	Police in India arrested nine people in connection with the collapse of a century-old suspension bridge in the western town of Morbi. 135 people died in the accident. (The collapse)
	5.	President Biden says he will push for new taxes on oil companies if the industry does not take action to lower fuel prices and boost domestic output. (The comments)
Our 'Quick Hits' section is created in partnership with Ground News, a website and app that rates the bias of news coverage and news outlets. 

Today's topic. 
Elon Musk. On Thursday, the world's richest person, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, secured his purchase of the social media platform Twitter for $44 billion, setting off a new era for a company whose product is frequently referred to as the "modern town square."
Musk's path to owning Twitter was long and arduous. After first attempting a hostile takeover, Musk then attempted to renege on the inflated offer and back out. The price was rich enough that Twitter opted to force the deal to completion, and after a bitter legal fight Musk finally saw it through. Last week, he officially took over the company. On Wednesday, he showed up at the company's office carrying a sink and quipped on camera that he wanted it to "sink in" he would be the new owner. "The bird is freed," Musk tweeted late Thursday night.
It didn't take long for things to get interesting. In one of his first moves, Musk fired several longtime Twitter executives: Chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde, and the company's general counsel Sean Edgett. Three days after taking over, he also posted a tweet in a reply to Hillary Clinton sharing a story with baseless allegations about the attack on Paul Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's husband, which suggested Pelosi was actually drunk and in a fight with a male prostitute (police have since confirmed Pelosi was the victim of a home intrusion, and Musk deleted his tweet without comment).
Now that Musk has taken over Twitter, speculation has become rampant about how he will moderate misinformation on the platform. Specifically, many users are curious whether he will allow former President Donald Trump back on as he has promised, or if he will continue to institute lifetime bans on certain users who violate the platform's rules. Musk says he plans to build a content moderation council with "widely diverse viewpoints'' that will meet to make big decisions on content and account reinstatements.
Already, change has come to Twitter in a big way. Logged out users, or those without an account, can now view content on Twitter.com's homepage. Previously, if you went to Twitter's homepage without an account, you would be prompted to create one to see things like trending topics. Employees say such a change would have previously taken weeks of deliberation, but this time the move happened swiftly with just a few employees' involvement.
Musk has also brought in his inner circle. Dozens of people from his family office, other companies and his social circle have been added to the Twitter directory and given company email addresses. His personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, is now acting as Twitter's general counsel.
Musk has said his priority is removing the armies of bots who operate on the platform and sometimes simultaneously push misinformation. He has suggested charging a monthly fee for the blue checkmark verification badges that appear next to someone's name when the authenticity of their account has been confirmed. This, Musk said, would be a good way to diversify revenue and make Twitter less reliant on advertisers, while also making it less vulnerable to bots.
Meanwhile, Musk has been pointing to Yoel Roth, the head of safety and integrity at Twitter, who is leading the charge to address a "surge" of hateful conduct on Twitter in the last few days. Roth says they've removed more than 1,500 accounts and reduced impressions on the content to nearly zero.
From his verified Twitter account, which now reads "Twitter Complaint Hotline Manager" in the profile, Musk has — among other things — suggested he may purge accounts that are inactive for 30 days, said the platform’s "commitment to brand safety is unchanged," and suggested the entire verification process was being "revamped." He’s also insisted repeatedly that nothing about Twitter's content moderation policies has changed yet.
Today, we're going to explore some reactions to Musk's takeover, with arguments from the right and left, then my take.

What the right is saying.
	•	The right is celebrating the takeover, and hopes Musk will bring balance to Twitter's content moderation policies.
	•	Some argue Musk was right to clean house, as Twitter's previous leadership was marred by bad decision making.
	•	Others suggest this is the beginning of a new social media era that will have less censorship than the one we’ve been living in.
In Fox News, David Marcus said Musk should "let freedom reign" in new Twitter.
"So, what could this takeover mean for Twitter and for the country? Musk has promised to restore many banned accounts, most notably that of former president Donald Trump. This is good news, by all means unlock the gates of Twitter jail," Marcus said. "The real opportunity for Musk to make a difference and achieve his goal of a global public square free from biased censorship is in content moderation. One thing he can and should do immediately is to sever all connections with third-party fact-checkers used by Twitter to judge what is or is not misinformation. The simple fact is that the American fact-checking industry is dangerously broken beyond repair.
"It was these supposed experts and credentialed institutions that crushed debate over COVID-19 policy under their censorious boot for 2 years. It was these same ill-informed technocrats who buried the Hunter Biden laptop story and wrongfully suspended the account of the New York Post," Marcus said. "The whole point of a marketplace of ideas is to let the market determine which are good or bad, which are true or false. When a prominent account posts an obvious lie, which happens about once every 15 seconds, there are thousands and thousands of users ready to point their fingers and laugh, bringing attention to the lie. And if even if some are missed it is better that a dozen lies go unchecked than that a single important truth be hidden from the people."
In The Federalist, Jordan Boyd praised Musk for cleaning house.
"By the gnashing of teeth and wailing from Twitter employees, corporate media mouthpieces, and other leftist elites who are quick to defend Big Tech censors, a stranger might think these Twitter heads were unjustly ousted. In reality, Agrawal, Segal, Gadde, and Edgett got what should have come to them two years ago when they knowingly interfered with the 2020 election to help install Joe Biden in the White House," Boyd said. "Twitter doesn’t like to admit who on its staff is ultimately responsible for the suppression of information that makes ruling elites and Democrats look bad, especially ahead of key elections, but it was under the now-fired leadership’s watch that Twitter banned and censored conservatives, Covid-19 jab skeptics, election-integrity supporters, legitimate reporting, and those who told the truth about the sexes.
"Oftentimes, Twitter executed this censorship with undeniable arrogance and no remorse. That’s why when Agrawal openly admitted that he believed Twitter’s 'role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation,' he wasn’t chided for contradicting the social media company’s supposed commitment to advancing free speech," she wrote. "Instead, he was rewarded with a short-lived spot as CEO and congratulated by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey for his 'transformational’ work. Agrawal quickly used that power to usher in a new era of partisan crackdowns. Gadde, who handed down the decision to ban the sitting president, wasn’t criticized for unjustly removing the sitting president and world’s biggest critic of Big Tech. Instead, her attempts to keep Trump and his campaign off of the internet were hailed as heroic, necessary, and moral."
National Review's editors said we are entering a new stage of the social media era.
"As we discovered during the pandemic, the government began suggesting what kind of tweets and posts they wanted to see," the editors said. "Right-wing rhetorical bomb throwers like Milo Yiannopoulos were permanently banned. Discussion of the Hunter Biden laptop story in the run-up to the 2020 election was suppressed. After January 6, a Twitter ban came for Donald Trump. Speech codes have been used to force figures like Jordan Peterson off the site. But when the satire-blind illiterates at Twitter’s anti-misinformation crew went after the Christian humor publication the Babylon Bee, they goaded billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk into action.
"Musk is certainly no conservative icon, and we are especially unnerved by his close business ties to China, one of the world’s most oppressive enemies of free speech. But there is reason to wish Musk well," they added. "Musk is an instinctive, not a doctrinaire, libertarian. He is a champion of free speech in an age when progressives associate free expression with harm and oppression... Just as we hope that a future Republican Congress does a thorough investigation of our nation’s public-health response, we hope Musk’s takeover of Twitter brings about an audit of this era’s social-media policies. A republic dedicated to liberty needs not just a free media, but media institutions that are themselves dedicated to free expression. In Musk’s Twitter, we may have that once again."

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left worry about the future of Twitter, and how Musk will moderate content.
	•	Some are concerned about the return of Trump, and the prospect of an ultra-rich person owning another information platform.
	•	Others are skeptical that Musk will ruin Twitter by abandoning moderation because he needs it to thrive if he wants to save his investment.
In The Guardian, Hamilton Nolan said Musk probably bought Twitter for the same reason "sickeningly rich" people throughout history become press barons: to control the conversation.
"About themselves, in particular, and secondly about their own economic interests, and thirdly about their own inevitably selfish, bizarre, half-witted political beliefs," he said. "Once you have ascended the ladder of wealth past buying real estate and cars and boats and models and the other tawdry baubles that come with money, there comes a time when a hardworking plutocrat begins to be irked by the fact that, beyond their sphere of servants, people are still talking trash about them. It upsets their sense of omnipotence. After the thrill of bending the material world to their whim has worn off, the desire to bend the public conversation – and, by extension, the public mind – to their own liking takes root.
"Elon Musk is, ironically, the exact type of person for whom Twitter is poison. Wealthy, powerful and celebrated, he could have kept his mouth shut and let his work speak for itself; instead, he uses Twitter, and reveals to all of us that the richest man in the richest nation in the history of the world is an unfunny meme guy easily seduced by the same sorts of ideas that grab the minds of Reddit-scrolling 13-year-old boys," Nolan wrote. "There is a lesson there about the inability of wealth to make someone interesting – but, setting that aside, there is a more relevant lesson about the danger of vast concentrations of wealth. Because when you mix the immature, half-baked, self-righteous grandiosity of a guy like Elon Musk with the ability to buy and sell multibillion-dollar global public corporations like toys, you have a recipe for chaotic, destructive stupidity on a staggering scale."
In The Washington Post, Greg Sargent warned about the frightening consequences.
"The world’s richest man buying perhaps the world’s most influential political echo chamber is the latest sign of a development that international relations experts have long feared: With tech giants amassing stratospheric levels of influence over global affairs, they are morphing into a species of geopolitical actor, with uncertain long-term consequences," he said. "Those experts have a term for this development: 'Technopolarity.' The idea is that big tech companies have become their own sovereigns, on a par with nation-states. The result: an increasingly unchecked level of influence over international affairs that will demand a new kind of political response.
"Musk’s acquisition of Twitter underscores the situation. Musk has already fired the company’s top executives, showing he intends to transform it. He’s widely expected to relax content moderation," Sargent said. "That, too, could have uncertain geopolitical consequences. One possibility is that Twitter becomes more hospitable to disinformation and online influence operations. If so, Russian propaganda designed to distort perceptions of the war and weaken support for Ukraine — in the United States and abroad — could become more widely seen... If Twitter permits more violent content... it could whip up violence against ethnic and religious minorities around the world and facilitate other persecution, such as the campaign China is carrying out against the Uyghur Muslims."
In Slate, Alex Kirshner wrote about why Musk isn't going to "open up the Nazi floodgates" on Twitter.
"Musk seems to enjoy Twitter. He seems to enjoy being a legend among conservative posters. So, sure, he may be inclined to throw them bones even in a reality where he is mostly focused on Twitter’s dollars and cents," Kirshner wrote. "He has said he thinks Trump should be allowed back on the platform, and that could set up an interesting quandary for the former president: Return to a platform he needs like he needs air to breathe, or avoid it in hopes of drawing traffic to Truth Social, his own much tinier corner of the internet. None of this will make Twitter more enjoyable for most people, or for many advertisers, but it also won’t kill the company. On the other hand, moves that hinder user growth or scare advertisers en masse won’t appetize Musk.
"For his many faults, Musk did not reach his perch in life by doing bad business to win political points," Kirshner said. "He makes those points when they’re cheap, and when they make him feel good, like when he didn’t actually own Twitter but could talk about what he’d do if he did. Now, Twitter’s gains and losses are his own. He could be rich enough to not mind lighting a many-billion-dollar investment on fire. That would be a change of pace, though. Something much more normal would be if Twitter remained a lot like it has always been, just with one narcissist dictating how it changes policy instead of a more varied board of directors with diffuse power. Maybe, after years of striving, Twitter can be more like Facebook.”

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	Musk's best and worst traits were on display this week.
	•	I suspect Twitter really won't change that much in the next five years.
	•	I'm still very uneasy about an ultra-worth person buying such an influential platform. 
The dichotomy of Elon Musk was on full display this week.
It's hard to argue with the business acumen of the world's richest man, a guy who is reshaping the auto industry in a way that previously seemed impossible, is seemingly leaving NASA in the rearview mirror on space travel, is sending internet to hard-to-reach offline places, and now runs one of the most influential social media networks on the planet. This week, he's been active on Twitter, responding to concerns about how the platform might change, elevating a longtime content moderator and presenting an open mind on what he can do to improve it by soliciting feedback in real time.
At the same time, we've also seen Elon being Elon. For a guy who professes concern about ensuring Twitter doesn't become a "free-for-all hellscape," as he put it, one of his first acts was hardly encouraging: He shared an obviously bogus story from a notoriously unreliable website suggesting the House Speaker's husband — currently sitting in the hospital with head injuries — was not the victim of a deranged political attack, but was actually caught up in some kind of lover's tryst with a male prostitute. The story was from a notorious fake news website that once alleged Hillary Clinton was replaced by a body double in 2016. He quietly deleted the tweet later, then trolled The New York Times for writing an article about it, as if it was no big deal that the platform's now most influential account was spreading obvious and actual fake news in his first days on the job.
In a lot of ways, Musk is the dog that caught the car. It's no secret that he didn't actually want Twitter at the price he got it for, if at all, and his hostile takeover — which may have been a huge troll job in the first place — has ended up costing him $44 billion. As Alex Kirshner put it: Twitter is "the company he tried to buy, then didn’t, then did again, then maybe didn’t, and finally did." Still, he isn’t stupid enough to light 20% of his net worth on fire for no good reason. He is going to try to make Twitter a more profitable platform, and he’s going to try to make it a better platform. My hope is he assembles a very qualified team to do so, but so far it looks like he is just turning to his inner-circle.
If you can put his sometimes grating personality aside for a moment, nearly all of Musk's suggestions for the platform strike me as smart or at least compelling. Yes, there should be a diverse council of people making content moderation decisions, not a group of political ideologues who all view the world the same way (as the previous team has been described). Yes, there should be some element of the platform that is paid, whether it's for large accounts or verified accounts or to unlock new features — relying solely on an advertising revenue model for a platform that routinely offends large swaths of its users probably isn't so smart.
I’m not a fan of lifetime bans. I didn't support the permanent ban of President Trump. I didn't support the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Musk seems to agree with me on these two things, though he hasn't made any big policy changes or announcements yet. We'll see.
I was glad when Musk was supposed to join Twitter's board and a bit more apprehensive when he decided to buy it. Since then, based on everything Musk has said and the reporting around what he's done internally, my position is that in five years Twitter probably won't be all that different than it is now. In fact, I suspect the entire circus around him taking it over will be looked back on as one of the great overreactions of 2022. If Musk can generate more revenue to roll out more features, actually eliminate the spambots (which he says is his number one priority) and usher in a more balanced moderation team, it may actually be a better platform in five years than it is now.
My greatest fear, though, the one I wrote about last time we covered this, is the uneasy feeling I can't shake of the world's richest person buying a platform that is critical to disseminating news. Of course, the world's richest men buying up news outlets and information ecosystems is hardly a new phenomenon, but it's unsettling nonetheless. At some point, Elon will be tested. A damaging piece of news will proliferate on the platform, and this one man will have the power to control it. Will it be a story about Tesla? About his business ties to China? About his unsettling family history? About a politician he supports? Or, perhaps, a story about how he is mismanaging Twitter as its new CEO?
None of that makes me comfortable, and it should make you uneasy, too.
For now, though, I'm willing to wait and see if and how the platform actually changes and what Musk actually does before passing judgment. I'm holding out hope we see more brilliance than bluster.

Your questions, answered.
Q: As the midterms approach, I've been seeing and receiving a lot of messaging about "grassroots" efforts, including one today about President Joe Biden, President Barack Obama, & John Fetterman "hosting a special grassroots event in Philadelphia." By strict definition this may be the case, but I've always believed grassroots implied the effort was not just targeting a region or community but was also locally-based, and I question how an event hosted by several nationally-recognized figures can be grassroots under that lens. Does the term mean anything these days or is it simply a buzzword (like "Main Street"), and how do the use of buzzwords like this impact our politics?
— Jesse, Havertown, Pennsylvania
Tangle: It's a keen observation. I would argue that at this point the word "grassroots" has basically been rendered meaningless. To me, “grassroots” principally implies an organization that is mostly made up of “ordinary” people whose work or day-to-day life is tied closely to that organization. A movement to raise the minimum wage, organized by a group of people who are being paid minimum wage, would be “grassroots.” This would be opposed to, say, a presidential-led movement or a local syndicate of a national organization.
Sometimes, for instance, I call Tangle a "grassroots" idea. To me, that's because I relied almost entirely on Tangle readers to spread the word about Tangle when I got this thing off the ground. I got about 30,000 subscribers to Tangle without spending a dollar on advertising — a "grassroots" push of the newsletter. But even with that usage I'm probably pushing the definition of the word.
Anyway, I think a lot of these now-meaningless words are thrown around a lot in politics. Reporters making $45,000 a year are often chastised as "elite." Normie Trump supporters are often called "fascists." Liberals are derided as "evil" for advocating for trans rights. Both sides throw out expressions like "existential threat" or “literally” or “nazi" or "conspiracy theory" with little attachment to their actual definitions. Unfortunately, that is just the world we're living in right now.

Under the radar.
Behind closed doors, the U.S. government — through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) — has been pressuring private platforms like Facebook to police speech. There is a formalized process for government officials to directly flag content on Facebook or Instagram and request that it be throttled or taken down. Documents collected by The Intercept via leaks and court cases reveal the DHS is broadening its efforts to curb online speech it considers dangerous. To this point, the work has remained unknown to the U.S. public. The Intercept has the story.

Numbers.
	•	~7,500. The number of employees at Twitter.
	•	25%. The percentage of those workers who will be laid off, according to reporting that Musk has denied.
	•	$20-$60 million. The amount of compensation the executives Musk fired were set to receive before Musk terminated them "for cause."
	•	238 million. The number of monetizable daily active Twitter users, according to the company.
	•	$44 billion. The final price Elon Musk paid for the platform.
	•	$223 billion. Musk's estimated net worth.

Have a nice day. 
You haven't heard a lot about the ozone layer recently; because we've done an awfully good job restoring it. Anyone who was alive in the 70s, 80s and 90s probably remembers the panic about holes in the ozone layer — and the deleterious impacts those holes could have on the planet. After scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were the main cause of the ozone depletion, a global response to ban the chemicals was swift and effective. Some 30 years later, new data from NASA — released on October 26 — indicates that the major holes in the ozone layer are now shrinking. Vox has a new piece about this success story.

How to set meaningful goals
Goals are essential reminders of where we are now—and where we want to go. We’ve got three tips (plus a few more) to set professional goals that are meaningful to you.
	•	Know your values: What kind of work has fulfilled you in the past? Ask yourself what’s most important to you about work. 
	•	Envision your ideal role: Think of what you want more of and less of at work—and how your goals ladder up to achieving that.
	•	Write it all down: Internalizing is helpful, but externalizing will bring your aspirations to life. Write down your goals, short- and long-term, to map out your journey to achieve them.
Set your goals
Ask Asana: When should I use a project instead of a task?
We get this question a lot. The answer depends on what you’re trying to achieve. 
The beauty of a task is in its simplicity. Create one if you’re trying to capture a single to-do for one person.
Projects allow for more flexibility. They’re ideal if you’re working on an initiative with lots of steps, stages, or stakeholders. Different views—calendar, timeline, and more—allow you to work with projects the way that works best for you.
Learn more about how to choose between projects and tasks.

Hi Bryant McArthur, 
 
You can now choose your channel’s handle. 
 
As a reminder, in most cases, if you already have a personalized URL for your channel, we’ve reserved this for you as your handle. If you’re happy with that handle then you’re all set. If you want a different handle from the one we reserved, you can change it. If you don’t already have a personalized URL today, you’ll also be able to choose a handle. Keep in mind that handles are unique to each channel, so once a handle has been chosen, it can’t be selected by anyone else.

In the future, your handle will be how people mention you in comments, Community posts, and more.

Subject: First things first.
Date: October 31, 2022 at 5:40:29 PM MDT
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Bcc: Bryant0918@gmail.com

¡Hola a todos!

It had been a CRAZY busy week. So much has happened, it's been a blur. We had transfers on Tuesday and I'm back with Elder Kingrey here in Hurricane, UT. We cover Hurricane, La Verkin, Toquerville, Virgin, and Springdale if any of you know where any of those places are. It's super close to Zion's National Park.

I don't have much time so I am just going to share a real quick miracle we saw this past week. Elder Kingrey and I decided to knock a few doors on Saturday morning and ran into a man named Jose. He just recently moved up here from Jalisco, Mexico about a month ago and was renting a room from a friend. He let us come in and share a message with him while he was eating lunch and we asked him if he had ever heard of baptism. He said no, so we explained it to him and he asked if he could get baptized tomorrow. We told him unfortunately he couldn't get baptized the following day but we could help him prepare for it in a few weeks! We invited him to church and he came! Our ward here is at 9am so it is always a blessing when the Lord helps one of our friends wake up early enough to make it! We are excited to continue to teach Jose.

I am in the book of Jacob right now in my reading of the Book of Mormon. I love Jacob's fearlessness. He is a great example of a God fearing man who chose to put the Lord's will in front of his own. Verses 18 and 19 really stood out to me while reading chapter 2:

18 But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.
19 And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.

The commandment and blessing is simple. Obtain a hope in Christ, then ye shall obtain riches. Couldn't be more simple than that! There are too many people who say that AFTER they obtain riches they will obtain a hope in Christ. That's not how it works. We must seek FIRST the kingdom of God, then all things will be added unto us. Not the other way around.

Put first things first.

Elder Rasmussen

Bryant,  At Tufts University School of Engineering, we know earning your graduate degree is about so much more than an MS. It’s about fostering connections. Exchanging new ideas. Gaining skills that set you apart. And creating a path toward your individual goals. We’re committed to helping you make your Tufts experience all your own, every step of the way. Here’s how:
	•	Small class sizes: We’re just small enough that classmates and faculty know you on a first-name basis, but large enough that you’ll have access to state-of-the-art facilities and resources that come with attending a premiere research university in a global tech hub.  
	•	One-on-one advising: With close guidance from faculty-advisors, you’ll have freedom to explore and experiment in engineering beyond the boundaries of your specific discipline. Have an interest in an engineering discipline outside of your own? Fold it into your program of study and research activity.  
	•	Professional development: Participate in graduate workshops designed to help you identify, map, and acquire a broad range of transferable skills. Explore topics ranging from grant writing and managing labs to developing effective scientific presentations.
Gain the support and flexibility you need to engineer your future:

To: Bryant <bryant0918@gmail.com>

Hi ACME friends, 

Happy Halloween! Here are some noteworthy items: 

1. The Math Dept Airtable was just updated. It is a good resource to see which companies have reached out to recruit from our department and/or hired Math or ACME students. 

2. Guest Speaker from PNNL
Aaron Luttman, Senior Technical Advisor and Mathematician from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory will present to Careers in Math
Wed, Nov. 2 at 4 pm in 1170

Here's a bit about him (the last line should stand out to you!) 
Biography: Dr. Aaron Luttman is a Senior Technical Advisor at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where his work focuses on understanding emerging challenges in nuclear security and developing scientific approaches to addressing them, both in support of the US nuclear weapons stockpile and in support of nuclear nonproliferation research.

From: Chairman Carson Jorgensen <info@utgop.org>
Subject: This is WHY it matters
Date: October 31, 2022 at 10:06:41 AM MDT

Reply-To: info@utgop.org

 
 
 
 
 
Why it matters...
 
Many of you do not know me, but you have received many emails and correspondence from me over the past 2 years. 
My name is Carson Jorgensen. I am the elected Chairman of the Utah Republican party. Albeit difficult, it has been an amazing opportunity to serve in this volunteer capacity. Pictured in this photo is my little family. This is why it matters. This is why I serve, because I worry about their future. As a father of 5 girls I understand first hand what you are going through. With the rising cost of food and living expenses, it is tough. Politics and poor policy has led to the average Utah family paying on average and extra $935 each month just for basic living expenses.
 
I need your help....
 
We are just 1 week away from the election. First and foremost, please turn in your ballots. Your vote matters this year more than ever before. Senator Lee is in a tough fight against someone who in no way represents us as Utahans. In 2020, a single Georgia senate seat cost the country 4 trillion dollars in reckless spending. Leading to this inflation that has us all feeling the effects. Let's make sure that Utah does our part to assure a House and Senate majority to stop this reckless spending and slow the effects of inflation.
 
Lastly....and importantly
 
The most difficult part of my job as Chairman of the UTGOP is making sure that we have the funding to be able to assure that our candidates can win these elections. Something I want you to know about me, as a 6th generation Utah rancher I have learned to work for every dime I have ever spent. Which makes it all the more difficult to ask for donations. The last few years though I have learned the cost of not doing nothing is much higher than a small donation. Help me to help you. If every person who receives this email were to donate just $10 it would assure that we do everything possible to get our candidates across the finish. We have expended all of our resources, and want to finish strong.
 
My friends, I am not a polished politician, I am not one of the political elite. I am just a sheep herder, but I care for this state, for all of you, your families and their future. Help me to help you, click the link below. Figure this as an investment, $10 or $20 to help bring back under control the inflation that is costing you $935 every month. We can't do it without you. Even if it is just this one time, I need your help now more than ever. I promise to you that I will work with our Federal Delegation, and our State Representatives to ensure that your family's bottom line is their top priority.
 
Thank You all. I look forward to continuing to serve you all. As well as assuring that Utah is a on the right track going into the future.
 
Best, 
Carson

Hey Snackers,
Another Halloween, another year of knockoff costumes. A few of our favorites: “Ten” from the hit show “Unusual Events.” “Evil Midweek Cutie” (definitely no relation to Wednesday Addams). “Fantastic Magician Boy” (who could it be?). Also a classic: “the rice is strange.”
Stocks rallied to end a turbulent week marked by iffy tech earnings and improving economic data (like: the US economy grew more than expected last quarter after shrinking). The S&P 500 gained 4% while the Dow surged nearly 6%, notching its fourth straight positive week.
Yesterday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro narrowly lost his bid for a second term to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

CREATIVE
“Generative AI” is booming, and it’s revolutionizing the way people make art — and money
Memes become Monet paintings… A new kind of AI is transforming the way people create art and do business. Generative AI uses deep learning and tons of data to convert text prompts into images, videos, and articles. We made the image above using gen-AI and a text prompt.
	•	Main character: OpenAI, which has raised billions from Microsoft and others, launched the first major gen-AI tool, Dall-E, last year. It was released to the public last month, and Reddit’s already filled with viral Dall-E creations.
	•	Other players: Stability AI raised $100M this month (at a $1B+ valuation) for its open-source gen-AI tool, Stable Diffusion. Meta, Google, Salesforce, and Adobe have built in-house gen-AIs, too, but they’re not publicly available.
Goofy images were only the start… Now entrepreneurs are putting gen-AI to work. 140+ gen-AI startups have launched in recent months: Jasper, which makes AI-generated blog posts, raised $125M at a $1.5B valuation last week. Companies can use it to automate copywriting (think: “a promotional post about air fryers in a friendly tone”). Other startups are auto-generating clothes, floorplans, and ad jingles. Microsoft added Dall-E to its design tools, and Shutterstock plans to use it to make stock images. But ethical concerns abound:
	•	Payment problems: Critics say gen-AI doesn’t compensate artists who create the content that “feeds” its algorithms (though Shutterstock has a “contributor” fund).
	•	Harassment hitches: Dall-E has safeguards, but some argue that gen-AI can still be used to produce celeb deepfakes and misinfo. Others say it replicates biases, like sexist imagery.
	•	Automation anxiety: Some fear gen-AI will put writers and designers out of work (others disagree).
 
THE TAKEAWAY
Highly visible = highly valuable… AI has many existing applications (think: self-driving cars, disease diagnosis, fraud protection),but it often operates behind the scenes. And yet generative AI has an accessible wow factor that’s already dazzled many. Some investors say it’ll be a huge industry: prominent VC firm Sequoia predicted that gen-AI could generate “trillions in value” and revolutionize industries that require humans to create original work.

EVENTS
Coming up this week...
Dressed up as Jerome Powell… because interest rates are terrifying. To be the Fed chair all you need are hiking clothes: America’s central bank is expected to raise rates by a “jumbo” 75 basis points on Wednesday — the fourth straight bump of that size. Soaring borrowing costs are spooking investors and raising recession red flags. Last week mortgage rates topped 7% for the first time in 20 years. But economists polled by Reuters said the Fed shouldn’t pause its hiking crusade till inflation drops to around half of its current level (a hot 8.2%).
Winter’s coming… While consumers are still feeling #PumpAnxiety, oil giants are still pumping record profits. Last week Exxon, Chevron, and Total demolished earnings with record results (Exxon took home a $20B profit). Analysts expect Marathon Petroleum and ConocoPhillips to deliver strong results when they report this week. Global oil and gas supplies are still tight from pandemic-era output cuts and the war in Ukraine. Now President Biden is urging Big Oil to boost production (and cut buybacks) ahead of winter.

ZOOM OUT
Stories we’re watching...
Well, that was underwhelming… Tech stocks plunged last week after uninspiring third-quarter earnings. Google’s sales growth slowed big-time as ad spending sagged, while Meta’s revenue dropped for a second straight quarter (and profit plunged 52%). What really turned investors off: weak forecasts for this holiday quarter. Amazon expects sales to be up just 2% to 8% from last year (a major slowdown). As tech forecasts fall back to earth, investors are adjusting their expectations. Then again, lower expectations might mean less market disappointment.
Trick or treat… But retailers aren’t spooked by candy-flation. Go-tos like Walmart, Costco, and Lowe’s widened their spooky selection by about 20%. This year Halloween spend is expected to hit a record $10.6B ($2B more than prepandemic), with Americans paying an average of at least $100 for goodies like fun-size candy bags, pumpkin plates, and wacky wigs (FYI: Home Depot sold out of its viral $200 life-size skeleton in one day). Hershey is thriving on its sweet-and-salty strategy and expects Halloween candy to make up 10% of its annual sales.

ICYMI
Last week's highlights...
	•	Jeezy: After 19 days of public backlash, Adidas ended its partnership with Kanye West’s Yeezy (nearly 10% of its revenue) after he made antisemitic statements. Balenciaga, Gap, Foot Locker, and CAA also dropped ties with West.
	•	Zucked: It was a rough week for Meta, whose shares have plunged 28% after it reported "train wreck" earnings. Investors weren't sold on Zuck's vision of the metaverse, or the company’s $15B splurge on it.
	•	Feast: YouTube star MrBeast is said to be seeking a $150M investment to boost his empire, from viral videos to Beast Burgers. VCs interested in access to his 107M+ YouTube subscribers may see it as "fans as a service.”

What else we're Snackin'
	•	Tweelon: Elon Musk completed his Twitter purchase, and then fired company execs including the CEO, CFO, top policy expert, and general counsel. The billionaire told advertisers the site wouldn't become a "hellscape," though GM’s already suspended its tweet ads.
	•	CryptoStuff: Crypto is confusing, but what if it was… less so? Bloomberg reporter Matt Levine dropped a book-length explainer on all things crypto that could be quoted at cocktail parties for years to come.
	•	WAO: Regulators charged a decentralized-crypto collab known as a DAO (picture: ants coordinating without a queen) with financial crimes, saying every member was liable. It could set an important crypto precedent.

Subject: How Katie Used Her Degree To Find The Perfect Niche

Hi Bryant,
Looking for a degree that will help you apply new skills to the topics YOU care the most about?
Today we want to introduce you to Katie Zawisa, a recent alum who carved out her perfect niche by combining her passion for digital marketing with a degree from the iSchool.
Katie finished her master’s degree in New Media Management from the Newhouse School of Public Communication in 2017 but, while diving deeper into her love for the subject, decided to join the iSchool’s emerging Applied Data Science program.
“I really like working with data, aggregating it, making it visualizing pleasing so people can tell what’s going on with the data,” she said.
The iSchool, while “competitive, smart, and kind of intimidating at first,” turned out to be a great fit. She’s now a Senior SEO Analyst at Terakeet — recently named one of the best places to work in New York.
Watch her story and discover how a degree in Applied Data Science or Information Systems can help your career take flight.
If you'd like to connect with our admissions team, faculty and current students, explore our virtual visit opportunities.  Best,
Zachary Schuster Director for Graduate Admissions and Recruitment School of Information Studies  igrad@syr.edu  P.S. We’re always available for a 1-on-1 meeting to answer your questions and explore the right options for you. Make an appointment today!

STREAM ALL SIX EPISODES OF TPUSA’S BORDER BATTLE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER

 The world’s leading companies recruit Heinz College Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) graduates for positions in business technology, data science, product management, consulting, and more. The graphic above gives you an idea of where our graduates have gone—and what they’re earning—over the past three years.  Heinz College treats career development as seriously as academics. The MISM program has three dedicated Career Counselors who work with MISM students, preparing them to secure employment. We are there with you every step of the way.  As a MISM student, you will begin career preparation before you even arrive on campus. When you arrive, you’ll meet one-on-one with your counselor to develop a personalized plan. Your counselor will work with you to develop networking skills, improve business etiquette, and prepare you to stand out in interviews. After you secure a job offer, your counselor will guide you through the negotiation and acceptance process.

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”

The rapper formerly known as Kanye West is a complicated person.
Of course, I don't know the man who now asks to go by Ye, his new legal name. I've never interviewed him and don't know anyone who knows him personally, so I'm stuck with only my love for the music in which he expresses himself, along with his public comments and persona. And, as a Jew here in America and a fan of his, I have to say the last few weeks have been distressing.
On social media, in podcast interviews, in television interviews and on YouTube, Ye has made a few things quite clear: He’s got some gripes with the Jews, who he believes are controlling the media, running the world, and destroying his family. He says he'd like to see their power clipped. He doesn't say exactly how, of course, which leaves the rest up to our imagination. But at first glance, his statements have not been ambiguous. He’s putting Jews on notice.
In case you've been living under a rock, here's a brief rundown of the actions of one of the world’s most popular musicians in the last month:
On October 3rd, West modeled a shirt reading "White Lives Matter" that stirred up a good deal of media attention and controversy. The next day he rode that attention into accusing Bernard Arnault, the CEO of a luxury goods company, of being responsible for the death of designer Virgil Abloh. (Abloh, a friend of West's, died of cancer). Three days after that, West sat for an interview with Tucker Carlson, from which the Fox News host later cut several overtly antisemitic segments that were consequently leaked to the media outlet Vice.
In one of the unaired clips Carlson hid from viewers, West tells the host he wished his kids were taught Hanukkah instead of Kwanzaa, because "at least it will come with some financial engineering." He also references the "12 lost tribes of Judah, the blood of Christ, who the people known as the Black race really are." (There are 12 tribes of Israel and Judah is one of Jacob's 12 sons, two Biblical narratives West seems to be confusing. But the belief that Black people are one of the 12 lost tribes is prominent among Black Hebrew Israelites, who are notoriously antisemitic).
The next day, on October 7th, West posted screenshots of a text conversation he was having with Sean "Diddy" Combs in which he tells Combs he will use their beef “as an example to show the Jewish people that told you to call me that no one can threaten or influence me.” A day later he warned on Twitter that he was going to go “death con 3 on Jewish people" (West later joked about misspelling “DEFCON,” and clarified that this meaning was how he was protecting himself from the Jews by raising his guard — i.e. going DEFCON 3). On October 12, the talk show The Shop refused to air an interview with West, citing hateful comments he made during their sit-down. On October 17, West announced plans to buy Parler, the Twitter alternative that promotes totally unencumbered free speech where — for whatever it's worth — hate speech against Jews is prominent.
That same day, West appeared on Chris Cuomo's new show to denounce the “Jewish underground media mafia” and decried the fact that "Black musicians signed to Jewish record labels and those Jewish record labels take ownership," which he says is “modern day slavery."
Like Noah's great flood, the comments rained from the heavens:
“Jewish people have owned the black voice," he said on one show. "Whether it’s through us wearing a Ralph Lauren shirt, or it’s all of us being signed to a record label, or having a Jewish manager, or being signed to a Jewish basketball team, or doing a movie on a Jewish platform like Disney.”
“You know they [the Jews] came into money through the lawyers, when after Wall Street when all of the, like, the Catholics, they wouldn’t divorce people so the Jewish lawyers came and they were willing to divorce people. That’s when they first came into their money," he said in another.
In one of the more bizarre instances, after Ye’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian revealed publicly that she had sex with her then-boyfriend Pete Davidson in front of a fireplace, Ye finally took responsibility for destroying their marriage and expressed his regret for not being a stable partner.
Just kidding.
He blamed the Jews.
"It’s Jewish Zionists that’s about that life, that’s telling this Christian woman that has four Black children to put that out as a message in the media," he said.
You get the idea.
Now, I should pause here to note that there are a lot of people who have excused West's comments, or at least tried to dismiss them, on account of his mental health issues. West has spoken openly about being bipolar, and plenty of observers believe the last month has been little more than a very public manic episode. That might be true. It’s also true that, at times, Ye has appeared to express admiration for Jews, such as for their “level of connections” to each other as Jewish people.
On the podcast Drink Champs, there seemed to be a breakthrough moment. After consecutive hours of Jew-bashing, one of the hosts tried to put his foot down.
“I want everybody to know, Black people, Jewish people, Kanye loves y’all,” he said.
“No,” West responded quickly. “I’m jealous of y’all.”
Again: I don't know West, and I'm certainly not privy to his mental health records, so I'm not going to opine on them here. Whether his anti-Semitism and mental illness are linked is, frankly, not very relevant to the larger picture it paints about this current moment. And ultimately it’s his responsibility to manage his condition, as many people with similar diagnoses do every day. Instead of ownership and responsibility, however, Ye has begun claiming that his bipolar diagnosis was actually just another conspiracy orchestrated by “Jewish people” — a Jewish trainer who took him to the hospital, and a Jewish doctor he says gave him the diagnosis and then leaked it to the press.
I don’t know how many of his recent statements I can dismiss to his condition, but what I do know is that he is the wealthiest musician in the world, and a cultural icon. In 2022, his words probably carry more influence than any living American politician not named Biden, Trump or Obama, and he has stepped into the political fray. He's professed support for former President Trump and even visited the White House. The Republican House Judiciary Twitter account recently tweeted "Kanye. Elon. Trump." An apparent endorsement of the group as a three-headed monster of conservative power. He is, in more ways than one, an influential political voice.
Encouragingly, the reaction to Ye’s comments was actually quite swift. Though antisemitism is often ignored or swept under the rug, in this case Ye got what he seemed to be looking for. His talent agency dropped him, his ex-wife denounced him, and The GAP and Adidas severed their relationships with him. He became a topic of articles at just about every news station in America, with the word “antisemitic” tied closely to his name.
However, the reaction itself is part of the struggle to confront this particular brand of antisemitism. Ye spews a narrative where Jews are all-powerful and a threat to Black people, he faces consequences for those comments, and thus his narrative about Jews is confirmed. Don’t you see what the Jews have done to Kanye now?
For those of us Jews with any sense of humor remaining about this sort of thing — which, I must admit, our number is dwindling — the funny thing about Ye's comments is just how preposterous they are. There's an old joke to the effect of "two Jews, three opinions." To put it plainly: Jews are far too busy fighting among themselves to take over the world. American Jews are politically divided, reformed Jews and Orthodox Jews are constantly at odds, and the secular Jews in Tel Aviv (Israel's version of Miami) and the religious Jews in Jerusalem (the holy city) couldn't be further apart from each other. Think our politics are chaotic? Take a look at Israel’s. Hell, if you could get your typical elderly Jewish couple to agree on a proper room temperature, you should probably go work for the United Nations.
To us Jews, who are told that G-d dances in heaven when his children defeat him in argument, who are elevated as “adults” at the age of 13, who are encouraged from a young age to be skeptical of the world around us, our lack of power, cohesion and influence is often self-evident. Which makes it easy to laugh at the notion of these secret Jewish mafia meetings none of us are ever invited to, where we chew on latkes and talk about which part of the house we want Kim Kardashian to make love to her new boyfriend in.
But there’s also something a lot less funny about it.
For starters, Ye's feelings about Jews are not unique to him. In many of these media appearances, he's been surrounded by podcast hosts or rapper friends who sit there and nod along, or exhale deeply in contemplative thought, as if the rapper is dishing out profound insights about life and Judaism during his rants. His feelings about Jews have also been echoed by other prominent Black artists with no record of mental health disorders, including Ice Cube, Nick Cannon and Jay Electronica. Actual neo-nazi groups cheered him on, and public displays of anti-Semitism (like the one below, on a major highway in Los Angeles) quickly followed.
 
A gathering that occurred over the 405 in Los Angeles. Twitter: Sam Yerbi
We've seen this whole dance before. When I wrote recently about Americans Seeing Ghosts, the idea that many of us are on such high alert for threats from the "others" that we often see things that aren't there, I wrote about empathizing with my own mom and grandmother's experiences as Jews in America that were markedly different than my own. For them, this script is familiar. Ye says antisemitic things. Ye faces consequences (like all the businesses now severing ties with him). And those consequences are held up as "proof" he's right.
As the writer Elad Nehorai put it: "We are now at the stage of antisemitic discourse where accountability is used as proof that Jews actually control the media etc. Up next on our regularly scheduled, circular programming: the part where Jews are murdered."
Regretfully, the staff here at Tangle has first-hand experience with this cycle. One of our editors, Ari Weitzman, had a cousin who was one of the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The four-year anniversary of that shooting was yesterday. The shooter, who killed 11 people and injured six inside a Pittsburgh synagogue, was motivated by his belief that Jews were orchestrating the entry of "invaders" (read: immigrants) into the country to kill "our people" (read: whites). I asked Ari if he wanted to write something about this ongoing controversy. This is what he said:
I’ve become non-religious into my adulthood, but I see how antisemitism pervades those receptive to the idea. It starts with jokes that you can’t take seriously on 8chan or Gab, and then the jokes start to become a bit more… bitter. Directed. Specific. “Jews control the economy” (eye-roll, lol) becomes “you’re unemployed because the Jews are keeping you down.” If you surround yourself with voices repeating the same lines, you eventually start to believe them. After belief comes anger, and with enough anger comes action. It’s sickeningly predictable.
Being non-religious hasn’t made me non-Jewish; antisemitism will always affect me. I was at a friend’s wedding in Vermont when I heard that my cousin was shot in Pittsburgh, by a man who went to the same high school as my mom. I sat in the back row in the church, checking over my back shoulder, feeling like an organ in another body. Wondering if this was the spark that lit the movement that rejected me, and all of us, from the American corpus. Learning what they tried to teach me in Hebrew school when I was a kid. We’re welcome here, but only for so long. Was this it?  A suffusion of little moments kept me grounded, kept me believing the shooter on October 27, 2018, was overwhelmed by the majority. Jews were still welcome here, antisemitism was still a fringe and lunatic belief in America. But this moment is the beginning of the next test, and I don’t have to wonder how it will go. Dismissal, hedging, irony, bitterness, anger… then action.
We can’t take Kanye seriously [dismissal]. Of course, he’d say something crazy, he’s been doing it for years [hedging]. But wouldn’t you know it, once he goes for the Jews… that’s when he gets canceled [irony]. It really just goes to show who has the power [bitterness]. And when you think about how much those people keep getting away with, over and over again, it makes you just want to [anger]… 
[action]
And how will the country respond this time?
The challenging part about Ye's antisemitism for me is that I actually want to ignore it. I didn’t want to write this piece, or take him too seriously and give him another platform. Ye oscillates belligerently in these interviews between explaining that he himself is a Jew to saying that he is the Blood of Christ to saying that he is a Christian, to that his dad was the original Steve Jobs, to proliferating the idea that we shouldn’t teach history in school (the only worthy topic is engineering, Ye says). And that this is all why he must share the warnings about the Jews. There are long periods of discussion where this artistic genius is totally incoherent — which makes his clearly articulated thoughts on Jews even more jolting.
Worse yet is the actual function of Ye’s words. It’s like someone picking up a dandelion of Jew hatred and blowing its seeds into the yard. When someone like him says “Jews control the media,” millions of people hear it. Tens of thousands might go Google “who owns ABC” and find that Dana Freedman, “born into a Jewish family,” is the Chairman of Disney General Entertainment Content. Hundreds may keep searching, connecting dots, confirming ideas, with their feelings about Jews boiling ever hotter. And, as Ari noted, that’s often how it starts.
Nipping those ideas in the bud is especially difficult because some of what Ye is saying is actually true. Like many stereotypes, the ones about Jews aren’t concocted out of thin air. Here I am, for example, a Jewish journalist quoting my Jewish editor writing in my politics newsletter about a rapper being antisemitic for believing that Jews control the media.
People’s inability to acknowledge this simple stuff — and then explain it — helps Ye’s hatred thrive. There are all sorts of potential reasons for this that are, frankly, not that interesting. I can try to give reasons for what Ye sees and ascribes to conspiracy.
First off, it is true that there are a lot of Jews in the media. At nearly every news organization I’ve worked or freelanced for there have been Jews. Simple Google searches about famous journalists or top media executives will reveal that, yes, lots of sons and daughters of Jewish mothers picked up the hobby of writing. I struggled to find any recent hard data on this. An academic paper from the 1980s noted that Jews were just slightly overrepresented in media ownership and in journalism as a profession. Still, I feel comfortable saying that today, Jews — who make up about 2% of the U.S. population — are probably still overrepresented in the press.
Jews are also overrepresented in Congress. 6.2% of Congress is Jewish, compared to just 2% of the U.S. population. But good luck getting Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Lee Zeldin to agree on anything. There are some big name corporate executives, lawyers, and — I can’t help but cringe — bankers who are Jews, too. All of this is true. And it's okay to admit that these things are true, while also pointing out that none of it makes what Ye is proposing any less ridiculous. In fact, denying this fact — that there are a lot of Jewish journalists or media executives or Hollywood directors or lawyers — will actually instigate more suspicion. Because anyone who takes the time to look will wonder why you are lying to them.
The best way to think of it is probably as some mix of cultural influences and social networking. Many Jewish immigrants got involved in Hollywood or media a century ago. That's really all it took. As with church groups or Muslim communities, Jews tend to know a lot of other Jews, and those Jews lean on each other and are influenced by each other and, when they need a job or career advice, might go to each other. This was especially true a couple of generations ago, when antisemitism in this country was more common and overt. Jews also tend toward careers that require liberal arts and language degrees, i.e. journalism, media, law and academia.
But there is always danger in the monolithic descriptions. Take my own story. I don't know of a single Jewish family member who was a professional writer or in the media. None of my childhood Jewish friends — and there are many — work in my world. I ended up as a journalist because I joined the school newspaper in order to get front row seats to basketball and football games at the University of Pittsburgh (and I switched my major to English when I was failing out of pre-med biology classes). Even the narrative around the financial success of Jews has some large holes. Look no further than the Hasidim in Brooklyn, many of whom live in abject poverty with failing schools. Not all Jews walk the same path.
But Ye’s theory requires all Jews to be in on the same conspiracy. Not only does this require a belief that the notable Jews in the media decide what to cover, how to cover it, and when to cover it, which on its face is silly (newsroom decisions are always collaborative, combative and driven by what people will read). It requires a belief that “they” all want the same thing. That “they” are all the same thing. That “they” are all focused on promoting some similar kind of world order. It's akin to observing the predominantly Black rosters of the NBA and then speaking about all those athletes as if they play the same position or are on the same team or share the same beliefs.
One of the storied tropes of the "Jewish media" is its purported shilling for Israel. On the left, many progressives believe The New York Times, a paper with several prominent Jewish reporters and columnists, is constantly infusing its coverage of the Middle East with pro-Israel bias. Yet many conservatives, Israelis and observant Jews believe the very same paper is overtly anti-Israel.
"Why is Jewish-owned press so consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?" Rupert Murdoch recently asked. Murdoch, of course, owns News Corp, which owns hundreds of local, national and international outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, Fox News, The Sun, and The Times. He is the most influential and powerful media mogul on the planet (and, perhaps for that reason, has been the subject of many rumors about his own Jewish heritage). Yet he feels the need to frame "Jewish-owned press" as the real threat — even though both sides accuse The Times of bias for polar opposite reasons.
Even more ironic is that The Times, once controlled by the Sulzbergers, a prominent Jewish family, is now led by chairman and publisher Arthur Sulzberger. He is half-Jewish, on his father's side, and was raised as an Episcopalian. To many Jews, Sulzberger's "assimilation" to gentile status is the actual threat. In other words: Antisemites see Arthur Sulzberger as the embodiment of the Jewish media mafia. Jews see Arthur Sulzberger as the embodiment of the dilution of our tradition and influence. All at the same time.
When Jews become the problem, you can see the problem everywhere.

This issue persists beyond the media. In the flier above, which was recently distributed in Los Angeles, Jews are framed as responsible for the Covid-19 response. The CDC, HHS, Pfizer and Moderna are all cited. Perhaps fliers like this are convincing for some people, but — again — the absurdity of it shouldn't be hard to spot. There are over 10,000 employees at the CDC, 60,000 at HHS, 80,000 at Pfizer, and 1,800 at Moderna. They found 11 who were Jews, and two who were “Shabbos Goy” — a term meaning non-Jew employed by Jews and which, even as a Jew, I had to look up.
Never mind that none of the people most responsible for the initial Covid-19 response — President Donald Trump, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx, and then-CDC Director Robert Redfield — are Jews, the more potent idea is that if you are looking for this kind of thing it isn't hard to find. It’s even easier if you claim any involved non-Jew is just “working for their agenda.”
It’s classic cherry-picking: taking the pieces of evidence that fit your theory, and ignoring the ones that don’t. I could point to the CEOs of GE (NBC), Westinghouse (CBS), or TCI (the largest cable company), who are all non-Jews. Same for the bigwigs at Hearst, Times Mirror, Chicago Tribune, Reader’s Digest, Sony, Dreamworks, and The Washington Post (Jeff Bezos). Ye mentioned that rappers (i.e. himself) wear Ralph Lauren, but notably leaves out Gucci, Versace, Dior, or Tommy Hilfiger (who, notably, has long been accused of antisemitism). The face of TMZ, which reported endlessly on Ye’s mental illness and is well-known for damaging the lives of celebrities, is Harvey Levin. Levin is — you guessed it — a Jew. The editors of Us and People, however, are not, so those pieces of evidence get discarded.
For Ye, it’s obviously personal. He seems to believe that the "Jewish media mafia" is collaborating against him and his family. In his telling, the Jews have, collectively, via their (again, monolithic and combined) power in the media, created a world where he is bipolar and his ex-wife wants to disclose her sexual escapades with other men to the press. West is clearly in pain about losing his family, and about how his public image has been tarnished by reporters. That pain has turned to anger, and that anger needs direction. So he's chosen the Chosen People.
In Ye's case, the idea appears to be that the Jews all want to destroy his family, screw over Black artists and promote progressive ideology. This is the dark twisted fantasy of Ye's worldview.
Ye is looking for reasons to blame the Jews. And now he's calling on millions of his fans to go looking, too.
There's no good ending here. In one outcome Ye is turning the Black and Jewish communities against each other, an upsetting bout of conflict where many Black Jews get stuck in the middle. Yet even the people offended by Ye's comments can't help but feed into the tropes. Some Black influencers expressed frustration that Ye has faced so few consequences for his "anti-Black" rhetoric or his “White Lives Matter” t-shirt, yet the moment he turned his ire to Jews he got "canceled." The explanation to me seems obvious. Adidas — a German company started by former Nazis and run almost entirely by white people — is a lot less likely to cut ties with a Black icon for his commentary about the Black community than they are for overt antisemitism. But once again, the Jews and their power, however subtly, become the problem.
Lex Fridman, the Soviet-born MIT professor, Jewish engineer, and famous YouTube host, took his best swing at an approach I would have taken if given the chance. He sat down with Ye for a two-hour interview about his comments, simultaneously showering his "friend" in love and empathy while also trying to hold him accountable for his broad brushes against the Jewish community. It was a valiant effort. At times, Fridman seemed to convince Ye of the danger of his rhetoric, and even offered the idea that Ye should simply call out the individuals he feels are harming him rather than generalize against the Jewish community as a whole. The advice would momentarily stick before Ye seemingly reverted to the same targeted anger and frustration he had when he first sat down for the interview.
Inoculating against this particular brand of conspiratorial discrimination is hard. If you joke about it to diffuse the tension, you're part of the problem for not taking it seriously enough. If you de-platform or cut ties with Ye, you're proof of the Jewish control center (even if you’re not Jewish). If you sit down with Ye and let him say his piece, you're platforming his conspiracies. If you push back on him and try to force an apology, you're another Jew writing his narrative. If you ignore it altogether, you risk allowing the ideas to flourish unencumbered. The only real way to avoid this is for Ye himself not to go on a months-long rant against Jews in the first place, but that genie is already out of the bottle. So here we are.
My proposition is this: Ye's view of Jews, his interpersonal grievances that are now manifesting as societal observations, are at the core of almost every kind of discrimination this country has. His is a story of a person in pain, a person with a grudge, a person who desperately wants to pin his own faults onto a group or system that he thinks is working against him. And, because those grievances are tied to a certain reality — a deal he was screwed over on, an unfair article written about him, a concocted narrative about his life — they are littered with little bits of truth.
Tacking those bits onto a cork board and connecting them with blue yarn in the pattern of a six-pointed star doesn’t prove a grand conspiracy, only the unquenchable desire to see one. But while the conspiracy is made up, the little bits of truth it’s founded on are not. Denying those truths will not disarm the hatred. Allowing these idiotic conspiracy theories to flourish without any repercussions will spread the madness. Our only option is to try to engage them with frankness and explore their absurdity. It's to make it clear that this society finds his rhetoric unacceptable, and to do our best to show him why.

Tutor the students in areas including business, digital design, engineering and health. This is a great resume builder and chance to serve the community. [Learn More]

Plus, yummy treats will be provided! 
4. More than $5,000 in prizes is available by sharing your photo skills. Submit your best photos for a chance to win prizes in the annual Dean of Students Photo Contest. The winning photos will be displayed in the Wilkinson Student Center.  
5. You can win prizes while offering community service. From November 7 through 12, join other students and alumni in a week-long service project. Learn more about how you can engage in service opportunities, earn points and win prizes. The grand prize is a round-trip flight from Breeze Airways out of the Provo Airport. 

Five Things to Do: Halloween Edition.

Today, we're covering the John Fetterman vs. Dr. Mehmet Oz debate. Plus, a question about how I think of Tangle, and a preview of tomorrow's subscribers-only Friday edition.
From today's advertiser: When I hear about the loss of "$7.3 trillion of blue-chip equity" or "inverted yield curves" — anything stock market-related — I turn to my friends at The Daily Upside to make sense of it all. It's a brand new (and free!) business newsletter started by a team of Wall Street insiders, bankers, and scholars that gives you access to insider insights. The Tangle team and 750,000+ people get it in their inbox, you should too. Sign up for free here.

Kanye piece.
After resisting it for the last few weeks, I am going to write about Kanye West tomorrow. Why? Because I think there is a lot to learn from Ye, an influential celebrity with significant political sway. And because I think there are a lot of things not being said about his recent comments on politics, Jews, and race that are worth discussing. This will be an unusual Tangle — and hopefully the last time we have to wade into a pop culture story for a little while.

Today's topic.
The Fetterman-Oz debate. In September, we covered the Pennsylvania Senate race. We’re giving this debate additional coverage for a few reasons: First, it's an open seat and a "toss-up" in polls, which makes the race’s dynamics unique. Second, many pollsters believe the Pennsylvania Senate race could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Finally, Pennsylvania is one of the most important swing states in presidential elections, so the result of this contest could not only mirror results nationally in the midterms but perhaps even foreshadow 2024.
This was one of the most anticipated and widely-watched debates of the 2022 midterms for other reasons, too. Fetterman, the Democrat, suffered a stroke in May, just before the primaries. His camp says he is recovering quickly but still experiencing auditory processing issues because of the stroke, which is a common occurrence in such patients. Specialists in stroke recovery say the condition is not indicative of his ability to understand or process information, but more akin to difficulty in hearing. It also manifests itself in his speaking, as he sometimes struggles to put words together, or mixes up conjugations.
Still, the campaign has been cagey about his health. In early June, they revealed that he had installed a defibrillator for a previously undisclosed diagnosis of cardiomyopathy (they had initially claimed it was surgery for the less serious atrial fibrillation). Fetterman's team has declined to release his full health records or brain scans since the stroke, but on October 15, his doctor, Clifford Chen, penned a letter noting that his blood pressure, heart rate, vitals, cholesterol, and liver function were all normal. Dr. Chen also said Fetterman had no cognitive impairment, coordination difficulties, or strength issues, but did acknowledge his auditory processing problems.
Over the last month, Fetterman's public appearances have become more common, including a sit-down interview he gave to NBC News reporter Dasha Burns. In her reporting, Burns noted that he appeared to struggle to understand her in small talk they had before going on camera, a comment that drew cries of "ableism" and led media critics to excoriate her for leaving out the context of his condition.
In that interview, Fetterman used closed captioning in his discussion with Burns, reading off a screen as they spoke. He used the same accommodations during the debate on Monday night. Throughout the debate, his answers were briefly delayed as he read the closed captioning, and he repeatedly misspoke or struggled to articulate responses, including on a question about his change of position on fracking.
Before the debate, his campaign sought to lower expectations, noting in a memo that Oz, a longtime TV celebrity, had a "huge built-in advantage" in public speaking and that debates were not Fetterman's best medium — even before the stroke.
With the intrigue surrounding Fetterman's health swirling, and polls showing the race tightening, the candidates debated abortion rights, crime, fracking, inflation, and other key issues in the midterms so far.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions from the right and left, then my take.

What the right is saying.
	•	Many on the right said the debate made it clear Fetterman wasn't fit for office.
	•	Some suggested his answers on the issues are proof Democrats have gone astray.
	•	Others expressed sadness and frustration that Fetterman is still in the race.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board said commentary is mostly about Fetterman's health, but that shouldn't be the sole focus.
"For our money the most telling moment was Mr. Fetterman’s response to a question about his previous opposition to fracking for natural gas... 'I’ve always supported fracking,' Mr. Fetterman said when pressed by a moderator. He later added that, 'I do support fracking and I don’t, I don’t—I support fracking, and I stand, and I do support fracking.' His stumbles over his real position is understandable because his pro-fracking conversion, if that’s what it is, is recent. 'I don’t support fracking at all and I never have,' Mr. Fetterman told a YouTube channel in 2018," the board said. "The point isn’t about catching a politician in a flip-flop. The Fetterman contradiction shows how Democrats are in trouble because they nominated too many candidates whose views on crime, immigration, climate and the economy are all but impossible to defend in competitive races this year.
"The left turn didn’t matter in 2018 as voters came out to put a check on Mr. Trump’s chaotic governance. It mattered more in 2020, especially after the 'summer of love' riots following George Floyd’s murder. 'Defund the police' cost the party House seats," the board added. "But Mr. Trump was still the main election issue, and Democrats played down their left turn by nominating the reassuring Joe Biden, who promised to work with Republicans and unite the country. Democrats have tried mightily to drag Mr. Trump back into the 2022 campaign, and Mr. Trump has often obliged by meddling in GOP primaries on behalf of weak candidates. But he isn’t on any ballot next month. Voters have thus had the chance to focus on the record of the Biden Democrats in office, and the policy views of Democratic challengers."
In The New York Post, John Podhoretz said it's an act of personal and political malpractice to keep Fetterman in the race.
"I’ve never seen anything like the Pennsylvania Senate debate between John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz on Tuesday night, and I hope never to have to see anything like it ever again. It was horrible," Podhoretz said. "The stroke that Fetterman himself said ‘knocked’ him down at the debate’s outset has impaired him. Full stop. Don’t believe anyone who even tries to tell you different, and you should probably not trust any such person to tell you whether you need an umbrella because you don’t know whether it’s raining.
"Seeing Fetterman struggle to answer simple questions and form simple sentences was nothing less than an agony," he wrote. "There’s no sense even in trying to characterize how he did in expressing himself on issues, or how Mehmet Oz did talking about matters ranging from abortion to fracking to Social Security. Only one thing mattered, and that was watching Fetterman try to make a showing of himself despite his painful impairment. I don’t want to quote what he said or make specific note of his speech patterns or answers because it would be unnecessarily cruel. Could Fetterman improve? Yes. Will he improve? We do not know. During the debate he refused to say he would release actual medical records rather than a clearly ginned-up letter from a doctor who is one of his donors."
In Broad and Liberty, a Philadelphia-based news outlet, Christine Flowers said the debate was "cruelty in real time."
"Fetterman performed so poorly, even he could not do a rhetorical limbo under a bar set unfairly low for him," she said. "He stammered. He gazed vacantly into the distance, collecting thoughts that would not come. He repeated platitudes devoid of detail about his concern for the working man. He contradicted himself, Fetterman who opposes fracking against Fetterman who supports it. He tried to harness the power of the aggrieved feminists with his insistence that he’d protect the right to choose…an abortion. He never mentioned the privilege of bearing a child. He floundered on how he’d bring down tuition costs, refused to even answer a question about releasing his medical records, and kept attacking his opponent Mehmet Oz for bad commercials.
"And I watched, and at first became elated at how poorly he’d done... But then, I stopped. The political became the personal," Flowers said. "This was a sick man. And I thought of his ambitious wife, pushing him onward despite his infirmity. I thought of doctors who were Democratic donors and prostituted their judgment for some political advantage. I thought of campaign operatives desperate to hide what could not be hidden forever, hoping to beat the electoral clock. I thought of the Fetterman children, deprived of a father at [a] time they needed him most, and he them... And I cried. I hate everything Fetterman represents. I hate the people who love him. They are anathema, and toxic. And yet, I cried for a man, not a movement. Politics is cruel. Tonight showed that, in technicolor terms. John Fetterman must go home. He deserves better. So do we."

What the left is saying. 
	•	Many on the left praise Fetterman for braving the debate stage, even if they worry about how his performance will impact the race.
	•	Some insist that we have no reason to believe he is unfit for office, and with the proper accommodations he could serve effectively as a senator.
	•	Others criticize Oz for his stances on issues like abortion and social security.
In MSNBC, Zeeshan Aleem said the "core difference" pundits will discuss is their communication style, but it shouldn't be the focus.
"Oz is a seasoned television host who knows how to speak with polish in front of a camera," Aleem said. "Fetterman has an I’m-just-a-normal-dude-in-a-bar conversational style of speech, which endears him to much of the public but also doesn’t always lend itself to snappy debate banter. On top of that, it was evident that Fetterman’s challenges with processing spoken language — a result of a stroke he suffered in May — made it hard for him at times to select and articulate words as he made his case for why he should be Pennsylvania’s next U.S. senator. While medical experts say there’s no reason to doubt Fetterman’s cognitive capacity, and while his overall points were intelligible, it was at times genuinely difficult to understand some of his sentences.
"Asked about foreign policy threats, Fetterman correctly identified China as having a potentially dangerous rivalry with the U.S., while Oz spread bizarre disinformation about the Iran nuclear deal," he wrote. "On immigration, Fetterman called for compassionate immigration reform and decried cruel stunts like sending asylum-seeking refugees in buses to Martha’s Vineyard; Oz, meanwhile, decided that the “humanitarian crisis” surrounding immigration could be mitigated only by stricter enforcement of immigration laws. While Fetterman called for the federal minimum wage to be raised to $15 an hour on the basis that workers deserved to have living wages, Oz offered up a confusing word salad about how the market was driving up the wage to $15 an hour anyway. To cap it all off, Oz (unsurprisingly) said he would support Donald Trump for the presidency again if he won the Republican nomination."
In CNN, Jill Filipovic said we should have "tremendous admiration" for Fetterman.
"He’s recovering from a stroke; he knows he is not as coherent and articulate as he was this time last year, and – because he is not in fact cognitively impaired – he is acutely aware of how much his mouth is not cooperating with his brain," Filipovic said. "He was asked to compete in an impossible arena, with his disabilities being among the worst kind for live television, and going toe-to-toe on live television with an opponent who is a professional television personality. And still, he showed up. That’s a kind of courage, character, and gumption we rarely see from practiced politicians with teams of careful advisers; it’s the kind of underdog story Americans love, at least when it’s in the movies.
"When asked about whether he would support a national abortion ban, Oz’s answer was troubling: Abortion rights, he said, should not be decided by the federal government, but should rather be a matter decided by a woman and her doctor… and 'local political leaders' who can collectively weigh in so that states – not women – 'can decide for themselves' whether abortion should be criminalized. In other words, abortion is not just a woman’s right – it’s an open political question... On the merits, I would bet that Fetterman’s positions are more in line with what Pennsylvania voters want. And Pennsylvania voters should understand, in no uncertain terms, that an Oz victory and a Republican majority in the Senate likely means a Republican attempt at a national abortion ban, Republican-led whittling-away at Social Security and further attacks on American democracy."
The Philadelphia Inquirer editorial board said Pennsylvanians should have "a great deal of respect" for Fetterman.
"Fetterman showed courage in taking the debate stage in Harrisburg. Many Americans — whether from lack of experience or lack of understanding — are unaccustomed to or uncomfortable with special accommodations for those with disabilities," the board said. "If elected to the U.S. Senate, Fetterman could become a role model in helping the nation better understand that a person’s struggles can also be a source of strength. Fetterman expects to gradually improve. He released a letter from his doctor that said, if elected, he would be able to serve in the Senate without problems. Fetterman has addressed his health somewhat, but he would be better served by being more open and honest about his challenges and prognoses.
"In the meantime, his Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz, the television doctor from New Jersey, could stand to improve his bedside manner. At one point during the back-and-forth on education, Oz offered this cheap shot: 'Obviously, I wasn’t clear enough for you to understand this.' Earlier, Oz’s communications adviser, Rachel Tripp, said if Fetterman 'had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn’t have had a major stroke.' These statements are callous attacks more befitting of a playground bully than a candidate for U.S. Senate," the board wrote. "Oz, who used to hold more liberal positions on guns and abortion, appears to be adapting to the cruelty campaign that sadly has become a hallmark of many members of his party. There may be no cure for that."

My take. 
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	It was a hard to watch, and I felt bad for Fetterman.
	•	This isn't as simple as him being "unfit" — but we need more clarity on his health issues.
	•	Regardless of how I feel, I'm confident that the debate on Tuesday will only hurt Fetterman politically. 
Like many others, I thought the debate was difficult to watch.
The Democratic candidate who was on stage Tuesday night was very clearly different from the man Pennsylvania voters had seen in the months and years leading up to May's primary. While dozens of news outlets trotted out quotes from medical doctors about his remarkable recovery, it's clear he is still struggling, quite publicly, with his new post-stroke reality. And there is an uncomfortableness in watching him try to push through that struggle in front of an audience of millions — one that is hard to shake. I feel for him.
But let’s get to the heart of the issue: Fetterman's trouble communicating should not render him unfit for the job. When you see a person who is having trouble speaking in the way Fetterman is, it might be hard to imagine they totally grasp what is happening around them. I am not a neurologist or speech pathologist or expert on stroke victims, so I will defer to the people who are. And they have made it quite clear that if Fetterman is suffering only from "auditory processing" issues, that is not indicative of some depleted cognitive function — i.e. his ability to problem solve, think through issues, understand his surroundings, etc. That distinction is important for a potential U.S. senator.
If the campaign is being honest about his health issues, what's happening to Fetterman is more akin to a serious stutter or hearing problem than some kind of intellectual or cognitive disability that would be deleterious for his work.
But the operative word here is "if."
Since his health problems started, Fetterman's team has been somewhere between cagey and wholly dishonest. As of this writing, the closest thing to a clean bill of health for Fetterman that voters have is a letter signed by a doctor who donated to his campaign. In the debate on Tuesday, he once again refused to commit to releasing his health records. So, when we discuss what we are seeing with Fetterman's health, we are working on the assumption his "auditory processing" issues are, in fact, the only real lingering health issues related to his stroke.
Of course, the Senate still likes to think of itself as the "world’s greatest deliberative body." A large part of the job is debate, discussion, hearings, and addresses on the Senate floor. He’ll have to cajole senators for support behind closed doors and work to rally votes on legislation he supports. On Tuesday, Fetterman had all the accommodations he'd seemingly get in the Senate and was at times still unintelligible. That's a problem.
But it may not be disqualifying. His condition may improve, Congress already counts several stroke survivors and people with disabilities as members, and if Fetterman needs closed captioning or a few extra seconds to ask questions and converse in a Senate hearing or on the floor — that obviously isn't something that should disqualify him from being in office.
The worse news for Fetterman is that he was standing across from a television pro. Oz knows how to command a room and garner attention on TV. He looked mostly smooth on stage, and one imagines a pre-stroke Fetterman may have called him out on one of the several lies or misleading comments he made during the debate. Instead, the toughest moment for Oz came when he implied "political leaders" should have a role in a woman's decision on abortion, something that is not going to play well with moderates in Pennsylvania.
Fetterman's worst moment came on fracking, an issue where he's flip-flopped, and his position was no clearer after the debate. It appears his campaign is pivoting into a pro-fracking stance, a stark contrast to where he stood at any point in the last few years.
The obvious question is: How much will any of this matter? On the one hand, 635,000 voters in Pennsylvania have already cast ballots, and it's hard to imagine too many people changing their minds at this point. On the other hand, poll aggregators show Fetterman with anywhere from a 1% to 3% lead, with 6% to 8% of the vote still up for grabs. Those are a lot of votes still on the table, and a lot of independent-minded swing voters in the Keystone State.
In a vacuum, I think Fetterman's policy positions are slightly more in line with the majority of Pennsylvania voters, which is probably why he started this campaign with such a healthy lead. That, paired with Oz's high unfavorability, tenuous support among the MAGA base, and vulnerabilities as a super-rich candidate who spent most of his life in New Jersey, made the race look like a solid blue hold early on. But elections aren’t simply about issues and candidate profiles. They’re also about basic human instincts, luck, and momentum.
Things have changed. Oz’s candidacy — one focused on crime, immigration, inflation and gas prices — feels very in line with the concerns of Pennsylvania voters right now. About a month ago, after lots of conversations with neighbors, friends, Uber drivers, and journalists in the Philadelphia and Bucks County area, I predicted on Twitter that Oz would win in Pennsylvania. Enthusiasm for him seemed to be growing, he's winning the sign wars in the suburbs, and I believe the polls are still under-representing pro-Trump conservatives.
I can only imagine Tuesday helped Oz. As Politico recently put it, "the median voter in Pennsylvania is a middle-aged white person with a mid-five-figure salary who did not attend college." Whatever your feelings about it, that voter is unlikely to engage in the "ableism" debate progressive activists and journalists are partaking in on Twitter, and even less likely to pore over a paywalled New York Times op-ed about auditory processing issues and stroke recovery.
They're going to see a candidate with health problems. And for anyone left on the fence in this extremely close race, that’s going to hurt Fetterman.

Your questions, answered.
Q: Do you see yourself as a political actor? Or do you see this newsletter as operating above politics, or outside it somehow, or something else?
— Anonymous, California
Tangle: That's a very interesting question. I definitely don't see myself as a "political actor," which sounds more to me like an activist, lobbyist, or politician. I think, first and foremost, I see myself as a journalist. That is my original craft and the career path that led to me creating Tangle. And the skills I learned in college, reporting on politics in my professional career, and at various journalism conferences are all skills I use every day for Tangle.
But, obviously, Tangle is about opinion, too. Most of the original reporting or writing we do comes in Friday editions. The Monday-Thursday newsletter is a lot of aggregating other people's opinions, distilling the best information available in an even-handed way, and then offering my own perspective. "My take" definitely includes some reporting, in that I often text, call, email and interview other people to help form my own opinions. But it's not traditional reporting, and I suppose the presence of “My take” makes me somewhat of a columnist, too.
As for the newsletter itself, I do like to think of it as operating "outside" politics. I believe Tangle and this community we're building are an antithesis to the "insider" D.C., beltway genre. We try to tap into the core tenets of any single issue and the ways that issue will affect Americans. In my eyes, we are detached from the everyday happenings of the sensational or outrage news cycle, and by stepping outside of it and collecting a diverse set of opinions on it, we can offer a more rational and nuanced perspective on what is happening in the U.S. and across the world.
At least, that's my goal...

Under the radar.
Members of a second railroad union have rejected a tentative agreement on wages and work conditions, upending weeks of calm after the White House brokered a deal to prevent a strike. The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen's latest vote means the two sides are headed back to the negotiating table, and failure to reach an agreement could mean a strike in December. A strike among railroad workers in the U.S. could cause chaos in an already shaky supply chain. Six of the 12 labor unions involved in this round of bargaining have ratified their agreements, but two of the largest are still in talks. The Wall Street Journal (paywall) has the story.

Numbers.
	•	$1 million. The amount of money raised by John Fetterman in the three hours after Tuesday's debate.
	•	2.4%. John Fetterman's current average polling lead over Mehmet Oz, according to aggregation of polls from FiveThirtyEight.
	•	1.3%. John Fetterman's current average polling lead over Mehmet Oz, according to aggregation of polls from RealClearPolitics.
	•	159 million. The number of Americans who get their health coverage through their employer.
	•	20%. The increase in premiums for health care coverage through an employer over the last five years.
	•	26,792. The number of people in the U.S. currently hospitalized from or with Covid-19.

A new app built by Berkeley researchers is warning people before earthquakes hit. This week, MyShake successfully gave California residents a nearly 20-second warning before a 5.1 magnitude earthquake hit the Bay Area on Tuesday. The app delivered the notification to 95,000 devices. It works by collecting motion data from your phone and uses a patented neural network to determine if the motion fits the model of an earthquake. Some two million people downloaded the app after Tuesday's successful warning, and the creators hope it can be used down the road in countries where alternative systems aren't available. Right now, the app is functioning in California, Oregon and Washington. SF Gate has the story.

To: bryant0918@gmail.com

 
Dear Bryant,  I recently invited you to explore Brandeis University's Computer Science, Computational Linguistics, and Mathematics programs.   At Brandeis, faculty-student mentoring is an essential component of the graduate experience, and one that distinguishes us from other institutions. Below are three professors who have won mentoring awards for their work with students in our Computer Science and Math departments.  I welcome you to request more information about our programs.  Sincerely, Jaclyn L. Farina Assistant Dean of Admission

Thomas Fai
 
Dr. Fai is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics and the 2022 recipient of the Dean's Mentorship Award. Nominating students described Fai as “encouraging, resourceful, patient, and transparent,” and they praise his willingness to “find opportunities for us to expand our network and gain professional skills beyond research.”

Lotus Goldberg
 
Dr. Goldberg is a Professor of Computational Linguistics and received the Dean's Mentorship Award in 2017. Nomination letters in support of Dr. Goldberg cited her "willingness to spend time with students outside the classroom, her relentless commitment to pedagogy, and her ability to connect students with other members of the Brandeis community."

Dmitry Kleinbock
 
Dr. Kleinbock is a Professor of Mathematics and the 2019 recipient of the Dean's Mentorship Award. Many students cited Kleinbock's research and academic abilities as motivational factors in their own work and described Kleinbock as a professional role model. Kleinbock has been a professor at Brandeis since 2000 and specializes in dynamics, lie groups, and number theory.
We have identified you as a potential candidate for our graduate community through the GRE Search Service.

*VIP BEST PRICE GUARANTEE: If you book an Express Deal®-branded reservation and you find a better rate up to midnight before the first day of travel, we’ll refund you 200% of the difference. For all other reservation types, if a lower price is found within 24 hours of initially making the reservation we will refund you 100% of the price difference. To be eligible for the guarantee, the lower rate cannot be an Express Deal® and must clearly show the name of the specific hotel, rental car company, or airline in the search results. Additionally, all reservation details must match the original reservation exactly - the hotel name, specific room type, rental car class, travel dates, flight itinerary, etc. Finally, the lower price must be available to the general public and not be discounted via coupon or require a membership affiliation (e.g. AARP, AAA, etc).

Priceline Express Deals® services are different from published price services. Exact hotel, rental car supplier, or flight itinerary is shown only after booking. All Express Deals® sales final. Free Cancellation does not apply to Express Deals® reservations. It also may not apply to all international reservations. Unsubscribe from our list. See Full Terms and Conditions.

RED CRED 
How Reddit NFTs became the hottest new trend of crypto winter
Reddit has long called itself the front page of the internet, but the social media mainstay might be vying to be the front page of the cryptoverse — or at least the NFT-verse. The NFT market is currently down a staggering 97% from its January peak, but many bright spots continue to emerge. Case in point: Reddit NFTs have dominated crypto conversations this week after they generated $2.5 million in daily trade volume, and prompted 3 million people to sign up for Reddit NFT wallets. But what exactly is Reddit’s NFT collection, why is it so popular, and how is it different from other social media companies’ web3 attempts? Let’s dig in.
What is Reddit’s NFT project and how does it work?
	•	First teased in 2021, Reddit’s Collectible Avatars are NFTs modeled off of the online forum’s alien avatar logo (their cute mascot named Snoo) that can be used as your profile photo on the platform. 
	•	To own a Collectible Avatar, you first need to set up a Reddit Vault wallet, which is powered by Polygon, a layer-2 blockchain.
	•	Reddit partnered with independent artists on the platform, who designed tens of thousands of unique versions of Snoo. Reddit’s Collectible Avatars have sold out on their marketplace, but secondary sales of the collections are available on OpenSea.
	•	Owners of multiple avatars can further customize profile pictures by using the site’s “avatar builder” to mix and match traits from their collection. Profiles also get a special visual treatment when users comment on posts, and Reddit gives NFT holders rights to display their Snoos anywhere on or off the platform.     

Why are Reddit’s collectibles seeing more success than NFT initiatives from social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram?
	•	Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter all have NFT integrations (and various, struggling web3 projects), but those initiatives focus on “showing off” NFTs purchased from marketplaces and adding your favorite as a profile picture. Meanwhile, Reddit’s NFT marketplace makes it a direct participant.
	•	Reddit’s strategy also focuses on its community by granting additional features to NFT owners and supporting creators — many of the artists behind the designs for the avatars were found directly on popular subreddits, like r/Comics and r/AdobeIllustrator. The company is also airdropping free NFTs to some of the most active users on the platform.
	•	Polygon’s role in the effort is also key. As a layer-2 blockchain, Polygon is compatible with Ethereum, while also allowing users to transact more quickly and for far less in network (gas) fees, thereby addressing two major barriers to crypto adoption.

So, just how popular are Reddit’s Collectible Avatars?
	•	Extremely popular. Millions of wallets were created to purchase from a supply of about 40,000 collectibles. Monday alone saw more than 16,000 Reddit NFT sales at an average of $206 per sale, which generated more than $3 million in sales volume. Overall, the highest sales came from Reddit’s earliest collection, released in July 2021, with one NFT selling for 115 ETH.
	•	Based on numbers revealed by Reddit Chief Product Officer Pali Bhat, Reddit has more than 3 million connected wallets, more than the leading marketplace, OpenSea, which has about 2.3 million users.

Why it matters… “Bear markets are for building” remains a guiding principle for many in the crypto industry during the current bear cycle. Even as NFT sales volumes have plummeted this year, Reddit’s success highlights the potential for NFTs — particularly when creativity and community are priorities for projects. Meanwhile, Reddit is likely going to continue to capitalize during the downtrend — astute users have noticed that the company has started teasing its Halloween avatar collection.

SECURITY BRIEFING 
4 security tips to help you keep your crypto safe from hackers
If a hacker had your DoorDash password, how many other accounts would they be able to access? If your answer is more than zero, it’s probably time to improve your password hygiene and fortify your digital accounts. For Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’ve put together a crash course for protecting your crypto and all the other valuable data you store online. Don’t stress, we’ve got you covered.
	•	Use a password manager. Humans are really bad at remembering passwords, which is why too many of us choose simple phrases and repeat them across multiple websites. Password managers (like 1password and Dashlane) generate strong, secure passwords and store them for you — no memorization required. (Want to see if your passwords have been exposed by a known data breach? Check out haveibeenpwned.com.)
	•	Enable 2-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA can protect an account even if a hacker steals your password. There are several types of 2FA, ranging from less secure (SMS-based, where a verification code is sent via text message) to more secure (an app that generates verification codes like Google Authenticator) to most secure (a hardware security key like a Yubikey). We recommend choosing a stronger method than SMS, because hackers can steal texts with a common method called “SIM-swapping” — in which your phone number is transferred to another device. If no other option is available, enable SMS 2FA —and if that’s not possible, consider using a different service.
	•	Protect your seed phrase. A seed phrase is a string of 12 to 24 words that is literally the key to a non-custodial crypto wallet like Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask. Anyone with access to your seed phrase has access to the crypto in that wallet. If you lose or delete your wallet, you can restore it with your seed phrase — but if you lose your seed phrase, you lose your crypto. (For many users, keeping crypto in the “hosted wallet” that comes with every Coinbase account is a more convenient option. You can add another layer of security without having to manage seed phrases by moving some crypto into a Coinbase Vault.)
	•	Don’t brag. In the sage words of Kendrick Lamar: be humble. Just like a brand new Lambo in your driveway could make you a target for burglars, flashing your gains (or losses!) online could make you a target for cybercriminals.

NUMBERS TO KNOW 
$1.8 billion
The total amount of royalties that have been paid to creators of Ethereum-based NFTs, according to a new report from Galaxy Digital. Ten major NFT collections account for 27% of all royalties — Bored Ape Yacht Club parent company Yuga Labs is in the top spot with about $150 million. Royalties have long been touted as a benefit for NFT creators that allows them to earn money anytime their work is resold.
$41,000
Price for the most expensive model of a mobile device called the Metavertu, a “web3 phone” that can run its own blockchain node and turn photos and videos into NFTs with a single click. Smartphone manufacturer Vertu’s extravagant tech also boasts 18K gold and diamonds, “Himilaya Alligator leather,” 1TB of storage, and 18GB of RAM. The most reasonably priced Metavertu? The “calf leather caramel brown” with 512GB, which will only burn a $3,300 hole in your pocket.
7.5x
Wealthy investors ages 21 to 43 are 7.5 times more likely to hold crypto than those 43 and older, per a new survey by Bank of America that gauged the investing attitudes of Americans with over $3 million of investable assets.

AROUND COINBASE 
Our $1.6 billion partnership with MakerDAO, Pomp’s chat with Brian, and the latest updates from Coinbase
	•	This week the MakerDAO community approved a Coinbase proposal that will allow the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to earn rewards on their treasury holdings of USDC. Coinbase’s proposal to custody up to $1.6 billion USDC with Coinbase Prime reflects its “commitment towards the growth of the overall stablecoin ecosystem and empowering the DeFi community and its users,” a blog post announcing the news explained. 
	•	In other USDC news, Coinbase has announced that it is waiving commission fees when customers buy or sell USDC via any fiat currency on Coinbase. Establishing global parity for all users will help accelerate adoption of USDC outside of the United States and support Coinbase’s mission of increasing economic freedom in the world. 
	•	In the latest episode of Around the Block, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong hosts entrepreneur, investor, and podcast host Anthony Pompliano, known to many in the crypto world as "Pomp.” The two discuss how they’re thinking about Bitcoin amid current market conditions, their long-term predictions for Ethereum post-Merge, censorship in tech, and even the names of Brian’s cats. Give it a listen here.
	•	Calling all Trolls and “Sim City” fans: Dreamworks Trolls VOX are digital collectibles that will live in the “VOXverse,” a soon-to-launch metaverse created by Will Wright, the mind behind “The Sims” and “Sim City.” Head to Coinbase NFT to mint a VOX today and participate in special VOXcoin rewards and gameplay.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund, exchange-traded fund, or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

This information is intended to be educational and is not tailored to the investment needs of any specific investor.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.

There are additional costs associated with option strategies that call for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads, straddles, and collars, as compared to a single option trade.
Sector investing can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry.

Diversification cannot ensure a profit or protect against loss.

Fidelity does not provide legal or tax advice and the information provided above is general in nature and should not be considered legal or tax advice. Consult with an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.

Foreign markets can be more volatile than U.S. markets due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, market, or economic developments, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. These risks are particularly significant for investments that focus on a single country or region.

ECH Newsletter
October, 2022 
ALL Donations Target Self-Reliance. 
Here are a few examples of impact you make happen! 
Self-Reliance Training:﻿
Each year your donations allow hundreds of aspiring adults, who are eager to learn, ascend from poverty.
 
Maria Amambal took ECH Self-Reliance classes with the dream of having her own sewing business. Maria graduated last spring and in addition to the generous Mother’s Day donations, Maria put some of her own hard-earned money to purchase a brand new sewing machine. Maria says she is VERY HAPPY and busy with her new business!
 
Out of the hundreds of people that take our Self-Reliance courses, over 80% graduate! 
Many are single parents like Magali Flores. She received a grant to build a cage she designed and is now raising guinea pigs with great success. She says she is happy to be able to provide for her son.

 
Associations of SR participants often result in pooling resources and talents for future endeavors. 
After taking ECH Self-Reliance training in La Arena, Peru, a group of farmers decided to work together to improve their situation. 
The municipality was encouraging farmers to plant oregano which differed from the traditional crop of rice.  Not many wanted to try due to lack of experience or fear of change. (In this area, water is an obstacle and the advantage of planting oregano is it does not need as much water to grow and adapts quickly to the environmental conditions.)
 
After the farmers received technical training from the municipality and business classes from ECH, your donations provided equipment for irrigation!  We thought the water problem was solved but the Sector announced a water cut for 2 months.
 
 Our farmers found themselves in a great dilemma since two months of water would not be enough to get the oregano to adapt and grow, but working together it was decided to plant beans, corn and sweet potatoes instead.

 
The association has been able to bring enough water to their land and plant almost three hectares of corn, sweet potatoes and beans. Despite many obstacles, this group of farmers have a strong desire to work and carry out the project for their families.

Children's Programs:
Monthly Child Sponsorships provide safe havens for children to receive nutritious meals, school supplies and tutoring in exchange for school attendance. 
 
Rays of Hope, in Jesus Peru, currently sponsors 48 students.
 
In addition to tutoring and the nutrition program, 
 
... children work in the garden ....
 
 
.......and are raising chickens, thanks to generous Giving Tuesday donations! 
 
Semillas De Amor
Seeds of Love provides a foundation to learn for over 100 students. Additional tutoring began last March for those who wanted extra help and the number of students who attend increases weekly! 

 
Raíces de Fe 
Isla Grande, Colombia, is home to over 50 children who attend Roots of Faith. ECH expedition participants built this children's center, sponsorships provide educational supplies and helps to pay the teacher's salary. Children who attend both school and the tutoring program can join the newly established soccer, dance and music programs! 
 
ECH also sponsors 70 children at the Enrique Vacas Galindo school, of Chilcapamba, Iltaqui Ecuador. 
The state provides a mush and milk. Your sponsorship provides vegetables, rice and lentils which mother's cook and serve daily. 
Here's a message from Mushuk, one of the students: 
 
"I'm 9 years old. My dad's name is Tupac Amaury Marcillo. I have 7 brothers and sisters. I thank you for the support you give us to all the boys and girls who study in our little school."
ECH thanks you for the amazing opportunities your donations provide! 
100% of Sponsorships go to the designated program! 
 Consider a Sponsorship with ECH today!

The pandemic learning losses.
BY ISAAC SAUL – 26 OCT 2022 – VIEW ONLINE →

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 12 minutes.
📓
Today, we're covering the results from the "Nation's Report Card," which showed significant drops in learning for fourth and eighth graders — tied to the pandemic — in both math and reading. We also have a major milestone and a reader question about Steve Bannon's sentence.
From today's advertiser: When I started Tangle, our goal was to create a platform where open-minded debate could thrive. Not long ago, Yascha Mounk set out on a similar journey when he created Persuasion, a (free!) nonprofit newsletter that tries to persuade you of one stance in every edition. Three times a week, you'll get short opinion pieces from some of today's leading thinkers.
If you're looking for a newsletter to expand your thinking and challenge your biases, give the free Persuasion newsletter a try (and tell them we sent you).

50,000 subscribers!
Yesterday, Tangle broke 50,000 subscribers for the first time ever. This is a huge milestone for us, and one I felt the need to acknowledge today. I still vididly remember sending our first newsletter out to 50 friends and family members three years ago.
It is hard to describe how rewarding it is to see so many people who believe in a news outlet that values diversity of opinion, debate, nuance, and fairness. It gives me renewed faith in the intellect and humility not just of Americans, but of folks across the world reading Tangle. Thank you.
While I have you: Now is a great time to spread the word about what we're doing. You can share Tangle via email by clicking here or on Twitter by clicking here.

	3.	Adidas and The Gap ended their relationships with Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) after a string of antisemitic comments the rapper has made on social media and in various media appearances. (The relationship)
	4.	The Congressional Progressive Caucus is withdrawing its letter to President Biden calling on him to couple military aid to Ukraine with a diplomatic push. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) blamed the letter's release on staff sending it "without vetting." (The letter) 
	5.	More than 500 protesters were indicted in Iran this week, including several who face potential death sentences. (The indictments)

Today's topic. 
Test scores. On Monday, the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) released "The Nation's Report Card," an annual assessment of reading and math scores for American fourth and eighth grade students. The results were discouraging: Math scores for fourth and eighth graders on the nationally representative tests showed the largest declines since NAEP testing began in 1990. Reading scores also declined in both grades.
While federal officials often caution against tying student performance to any outlying factors, this time was unique. Peggy Carr, the National Center for Education Statistics Commissioner, attributed the "troubling" declines to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on student achievement.
From USA Today:
In 2022, average reading scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by three points from 2019, and average math scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by five and eight points respectively, the test results show. The test, which involved 446,700 students at 10,970 schools, across all states at the beginning of the calendar year, is scored on a scale of 0 to 500. The 2022 results also show … the lowest-performing students performed even worse. And of particular concern, more students scored at what are considered "below basic" levels.
The tricky part about keeping schools open was never really about the kids, though. Even if students have been mostly safe from serious Covid-19, teachers, administrators, janitors and other staff weren't. And, of course, a lot of kids live in homes with elderly or otherwise high-risk family members, making the risks of them bringing the virus home very high.
Still, the learning loss is a stark reminder that nearly all policy upsides come with downsides, too. In a crude manner, policymakers had to weigh how many potential deaths or serious illnesses among family and staff were worth a certain level of learning loss for students. Anyone who confidently opines on where that line is should check their ego. I certainly don't envy the position policymakers and administrators were put in.
If we could go back and have a redo, though, there are plenty of things I think we could have done differently. The most obvious is that we should have emphasized in-person learning and put most of our Covid-19 testing resources into getting kids back to school. Rather than default to distance learning and set bars for returning to school, a more holistic policy may have been defaulting to in-person learning and using testing to decide when to send kids home. The strain distance learning put not just on students, but on low-income parents who relied on school for childcare and lunches, is hard to overstate.
Other things that were obvious then have been borne out now: Higher-performing students were more likely to have a computer or tablet at home, high-speed internet, and a quiet room to participate in class from. In a Covid-19 re-do, federal and state funding could have prioritized either closing those gaps, or simply keeping kids in school for in-person learning who didn't have the space and resources to reasonably participate in classes at home.
Again, none of this is simple, but the results — a wave of learning loss on top of two years of parents being strained by childcare — were obvious to parents and critics of remote learning at the time.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left worries about the already underserved students who are falling even farther behind.
	•	Some emphasize that losses occurred across the country, regardless of how Covid-19 was handled.
	•	Others say we need to smartly use allocated federal funds to close the gap.
The Los Angeles Times editorial board said "it's no surprise" that educational achievement suffered everywhere.
"But it’s still distressing to see the desolate picture of students’ academics and ever-widening gap between low- and high-performing students revealed by the latest national proficiency test scores," the editorial board said. "California students fared slightly better than students in most other states, with small declines in math but less significant changes in reading. However, California students are still underperforming compared with national standards. Most troublingly, low-performing students’ scores declined at much higher rates than higher-performing students. For example, the average score in 2022 for students at Los Angeles Unified schools who are eligible for the free lunch program was 35 points lower than students who didn’t qualify for that program. In 2002, that difference was only 14 points.
"It’s clear that a multi-pronged approach to boosting student performance will be necessary, but state and local educators and policymakers should ensure that decisions about how to allocate resources are driven by data and other evidence. California schools received $15 billion from the American Rescue Plan," they wrote. "The state created the $4.6-billion Expanded Learning Opportunity Grant in 2021, issuing a set of guidelines for districts to spend on designated support such as additional staff, but it’s up to districts to come up with plans that meet their needs... Now that educators have the funds and the data to help guide them, they should use that money wisely. Our children’s future depends on it."
In The Washington Post, Eugene Robinson argued that it wasn't just blue states who suffered serious learning loss.
"It turns out that all the bitter back-and-forth between red and blue states about how quickly to reopen schools during the covid-19 pandemic was nothing but political theater, as far as test scores are concerned," Robinson said. "Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, for example, made a big show of reopening their states’ schools in the fall of 2020, with DeSantis going so far as to threaten to withhold funding from school districts that did not comply. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, on the other hand, moved more slowly, conditioning the return to in-person instruction on the level of covid-19 infection in a given county. But the NAEP report, based on testing this spring, showed that student performance suffered equally despite the different approaches.
"Math scores for fourth-graders dropped by four points in California, five points in Florida and five points in Texas," Robinson said. "For eighth-graders, scores dropped by six points in California, seven points in Florida and seven points in Texas. Scores in reading in those three states also moved in lockstep, falling by a point or two. Political posturing might have mattered to governors who’d like to be president someday, but it made no difference to the millions of children in the nation’s schools. From the students’ point of view, there was no 'right way' to blunt the impact of the pandemic. All strategies, we now know, were equally futile."
In The Hill, Javaid Siddiqi said we're failing our most vulnerable students.
"While reviewing the report, some statistics jumped out at me: that Black students experienced a mathematics score drop seven points higher than their white peers; that, despite showing steady gains for the last 20 years prior to the pandemic, Black and Hispanic students’ scores have regressed to where they were in 1999; that students who were already struggling before the pandemic showed the most dramatic declines," Siddiqi said. "These results, while concerning, are not surprising. They mirror other recent studies that have found that schools attended by predominantly Black and Hispanic students — which we know tend to have less funding and resources even in the best of times — were more negatively impacted than predominately white schools.
"In addition to addressing the immediacy of this pandemic-related learning loss, we must also consider long-term strategies to ensure our systems are built to effectively support all students," Siddiqi wrote. "Research has shown unequivocally that educators of color increase the performance of all students, particularly students of color. Similarly, having school leaders of color creates pathways that lead to better outcomes for students of color as well. In fact, we know that having a diverse educator workforce is a benefit to all students and communities... While these results are alarming, and we should be prepared for more of the same when state-level NAEP results are released in November, all is not lost. We have strategies that can close these gaps — as well as time-sensitive federal relief funding to adopt these approaches."

What the right is saying.
	•	The right says we failed our children with poor policy decisions, and blames many Democratic politicians.
	•	Some emphasize the differences in scores between public and private schools.
	•	Others say the data shows how disastrous remote learning really was.
National Review's editors said we "failed the children of the pandemic."
"The declines were not evenly distributed nationwide," the editors wrote. "New York City, which had longer periods of Zoom school and imposed masks on children until very recently, experienced a record drop in math scores. Washington, D.C., and Maryland saw double-digit declines in fourth- and eighth-grade math. Meanwhile, Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis, an early opponent of school closures, is spiking the football. Florida achieved its highest-ever rankings in fourth- and eighth-grade math and reading. The federal government spent $123 billion last year on public schools in an effort to help children catch up from Covid-era learning loss. These test results show the effort failed.
"Democrat-led areas had longer school closures," they said. "The reckoning for this failure has to be system-wide. The CDC allowed its own recommendations on in-person education to be shaped by lobbyists from the American Federation of Teachers. Experts, acting in concert with Democratic state officials, were so anxious to flatter teachers as an extension of the white-collar Zoom class that they have surrendered their reputation as defenders of public education to Republicans such as DeSantis, Georgia’s Brian Kemp, and Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin. Parents are already making their own choices. In 2022, 2 million fewer students enrolled in public schools in America. A decades-long decline in parochial-school enrollment has been reversed. Private schools that stayed open and provided parents with free choices about masks and vaccines are thriving."
The Washington Examiner said the test scores illustrate the "disaster of distance learning."
"Chalk this up once again to Democrats' obsession with rewarding political allies at the expense of the public," the Examiner said. "Although there are surely other culprits — in Virginia, for example, Democratic appointees watered down educational standards starting in 2015, followed by precipitous declines in proficiency — the obvious culprit for most of the national decline is distance learning during COVID. And there's no question that the closures contributed significantly to the decline in learning. There are two proofs of this. First, Catholic schools almost everywhere were open full time by the fall of 2020, and on aggregate, the data show that they avoided the worst of the learning loss, avoiding declines in proficiency in fourth grade math and eighth grade reading.
"Moreover, states that kept more schools open experienced smaller declines in proficiency than their peers — a statistically significant result that this chart illustrates graphically," they said. "Once it was clear that COVID was not a major threat to children, that they were neither likely to suffer severe symptoms nor to pass the disease to others, every schoolhouse in America should have reopened immediately for in-person instruction... Unfortunately, special interests run many state educational bureaucracies, and of course, special interests positively own the Biden administration. Government emails obtained by journalists damningly demonstrate that President Joe Biden's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even reversed its scientific judgments about school closures based on pressure from the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union."
In Deseret News, Bethany Mandel said it is bad policy from the privileged, not Covid-19, that hurt students.
"How did those at the head of federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in addition to those working in education policy nationally and on a state level (not to mention their media defenders), get our COVID-19 response so wrong? The answer can be explained in one word: privilege," Mandel wrote. "Many students were in single-parent homes without robust support systems. There was no mom or dad sitting at the dining-room table trying to help them log onto Zoom or work through a math worksheet; many of these parents were essential workers out delivering packages and food to those who had the privilege of working from home.
"When these kids had problems, there was no one around to help them, so they just didn’t log in," she wrote. "Of course these kids have fallen even farther behind. It wasn’t that Zoom learning (an already inadequate solution) wasn’t happening in these homes; there was no learning at all taking place. Those in positions of power and privilege who set education policy were completely disconnected from this existence. If they even had school-aged children, they were using their privilege to make sure their children didn’t fall behind by sending them to private schools, hiring tutors or doing the tutoring themselves. They simply couldn’t fathom that there were parents who could not do the same."

My take.

It's a really difficult report to see.
Throughout the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the long-term impact of remote learning and school closures. And as worried as some of the most ardent critics were, I think these test scores actually paint a more troubling picture than many imagined. A math decline equivalent to nearly an entire year of learning will put tens of millions of K-12 students behind for the rest of their time in school. Some, of course, will catch up. But it will take several years, if not more, to do that.
Hindsight, of course, is 20/20. I wrote regularly about my belief that students should have gone back to school sooner — and that, by summer of 2021, even masking them was a questionable policy. In July of 2021, I wrote this:
The highest-end estimate for Covid-19 deaths among children is about 500, though the official tally is 335. The CDC estimates that 600 kids died of the flu during the 2017-2018 season. But recent studies, including the latest in England, indicate that — unlike deaths in adults — we could be overcounting Covid-19 deaths in children. 99.995% of the 469,982 kids in England who got Covid-19 survived. Of the 61 deaths linked to a positive Covid-19 test, the study found only 25 were actually caused by the illness. Furthermore, of those 25 children, 15 had underlying serious illnesses. Study after study has shown kids’ risk of serious Covid-19 illness is extremely low.
The tricky part about keeping schools open was never really about the kids, though. Even if students have been mostly safe from serious Covid-19, teachers, administrators, janitors and other staff weren't. And, of course, a lot of kids live in homes with elderly or otherwise high-risk family members, making the risks of them bringing the virus home very high.
Still, the learning loss is a stark reminder that nearly all policy upsides come with downsides, too. In a crude manner, policymakers had to weigh how many potential deaths or serious illnesses among family and staff were worth a certain level of learning loss for students. Anyone who confidently opines on where that line is should check their ego. I certainly don't envy the position policymakers and administrators were put in.
If we could go back and have a redo, though, there are plenty of things I think we could have done differently. The most obvious is that we should have emphasized in-person learning and put most of our Covid-19 testing resources into getting kids back into schools. Rather than default to distance learning and set bars for returning to the classroom, a more holistic policy may have been defaulting to in-person learning and using testing to decide when to send kids home. The strain distance learning put not just on students, but on low-income parents who relied on school for childcare and lunches, is hard to overstate.
Other things that were obvious then have been borne out now: Higher-performing students were more likely to have a computer or tablet at home, high-speed internet, and a quiet room to participate in class from. In a Covid-19 re-do, federal and state funding could have prioritized either closing those gaps, or simply keeping kids in school for in-person learning who didn't have the space and resources to reasonably participate in classes at home.
Again, none of this is simple, but the results — a wave of learning loss on top of two years of parents being strained by childcare — were obvious to parents and critics of remote learning at the time.

Your questions, answered. 
Q: Steve Bannon just got slapped on the wrist by a judge, but I was surprised that the judgment didn't include forcing him to submit to the Congressional subpoena. Why not?
— John, Oberlin, Ohio
Tangle: Well, in simple terms, you can't force anyone to testify. The "forcing" is the punishment Bannon got: the threat of jail time and a fine. If he is willing to serve jail time and pay the fine, he's served the punishment for refusing to comply with the subpoena, and that is basically as far as the court can go.
For what it's worth, I think part of Bannon's case was a bit more complicated than it was often made out to be. Obviously, he was in contempt of Congress, and refused to comply with the subpoena. And as I've said before I think his defense (that all his conversations with the president were privileged) was rather farcical. But Bannon did hire a legal team, engage the committee in dialogue, and said he was willing to testify if the issue about the privileged conversations was resolved. His lawyers also benefited from a huge mistake by the government prosecutors, who, while trying to retrieve emails and phone logs of Bannon's lawyer Robert Costello, accidentally filed the records of a different man by the same name.
It's also worth noting that the Jan. 6 committee opted against a civil lawsuit to enforce its subpoena, and that Bannon — as the judge put it — seemed to be relying on his lawyer's advice, rather than acting on his own in defiance of the committee.
For now, though, Bannon is free pending appeal, and has suffered few consequences for his actions except a $6,500 fine. I would love to see him testify, and agree that (unless he serves actual time) it is a slap on the wrist. But if he is willing to eat the punishment there is really no other plausible legal recourse.

Under the radar. 
The number of disabled people in the workforce has surged, according to new research by the New York Fed. Likely because of long Covid, some 900,000 disabled people entered the workforce since 2020. Right now, with a hot labor market, employers are likely to accomodate their needs. But so,e people worry that as the economy cools, those employers may become less accomodating. There were 1.05 million more disabled working-age Americans in August 2022 compared to January 2020, according to the data, which was compiled by economist Richard Deitz. Axios has the story. 

Numbers.
	•	70%. The percentage of kids in the NAEP survey who said they had learned remotely during the last part of the previous year.
	•	41. The number of states where math scores for fourth graders declined.
	•	10,000. The number of schools sampled in the survey. 
	•	$123 billion. The overall investment the federal government made in schools last year.
	•	$2,400. The cost, per student, of that investment. 
	•	20%. The amount of that funding districts are required to spend on academic recovery. 

Have a nice day.   
An injured hiker in Colorado was rescued after a train passenger spotted her from his window. The hiker, a woman from New Mexico in her 20s, had been missing for two days after taking a fall down a cliff face. The rider alerted the crew of the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge diesel engine and then notified the train inspector, in a motor car behind them. The inspector, Delton Henry, was able to stop and communicate with the woman. She had spent the last two days trying to flag down trains before being noticed. A CareFlight helicopter evacuated the woman and she is now recovering in the hospital. NPR has the story.

Title:  “The Impact of Concept Drift on Anomaly Detection for Maritime Trajectory Analytics”
 
Abstract: Anomalies in national security operations are often high risk, and need to be detected quickly from real world, incoming data-sources. Hence it is critical that we develop unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that both operate on a stream and adapt to it. Real world data streams involve multiple, intersecting forms of concept drift, meaning that the underlying data distribution changes over time. In this talk, we present our work developing generalizable techniques for adapting existing unsupervised anomaly detection pipelines to handle multiple types of concept drift simultaneously. This presentation is driven by an exciting application space relevant to both national security and the environment: anomaly detection for maritime trajectory analytics.

Your app is going to sleep

The app at https://cloud9checkin.streamlitapp.com hasn't seen traffic in the past 5 days, so it will go to sleep on October 27, 2022 to help conserve resources. Once this happens, visitors will need to wake the app, which can take a minute or two.

Want to keep your app awake? Just visit it before October 27, 2022.

*VIP BEST PRICE GUARANTEE: If you book an Express Deal®-branded reservation and you find a better rate up to midnight before the first day of travel, we’ll refund you 200% of the difference. For all other reservation types, if a lower price is found within 24 hours of initially making the reservation we will refund you 100% of the price difference. To be eligible for the guarantee, the lower rate cannot be an Express Deal® and must clearly show the name of the specific hotel, rental car company, or airline in the search results.

Subject: We're Updating Our Subscriber Agreement
Date: October 25, 2022 at 2:15:04 PM MDT
To: <bryant0918@gmail.com>
Reply-To: "Hulu" <reply-fe8c1077746c007f7c-48_HTML-405996401-1064447-32221@hulumail.com>

We're Updating Our Subscriber Agreement 
We wanted to let you know that we are updating our Subscriber Agreement (formerly called our “Terms of Use”). As part of our update, we took the opportunity to make certain changes to our terms for consistency with those of our related services, Disney+ and ESPN+, and streamline them to be even easier to read.

These terms will apply as of today for new subscribers. For prior and existing subscribers, like you, these terms will be effective beginning on November 17, 2022 (and the prior version will apply until then).

We encourage you to review the updated Subscriber Agreement in full and save a copy for your files. Once effective, it will govern your use and enjoyment of the Hulu service. We are as committed as ever to making sure you have an enjoyable streaming experience. Please visit our Help Center for more information about your subscription.

We have highlighted some of the changes for your reference:

	•	• With the launch of the Disney+ ad-supported tier, we’re describing Hulu’s tiers and how subscriptions may differ, including with respect to registration eligibility, features, pricing, and other factors.
	•	
	•	• We're clarifying the ways in which we may notify you of changes in our Subscriber Agreement.
	•	
	•	• We're describing simplified approaches to registration and billing for certain services, including the Disney Bundle.
	•	
	•	• We're explaining that subscriptions to the Disney Bundle will be subject to terms and disclosures presented during the sign-up and purchase process and related FAQs in our Help Center.
	•	
	•	• We're updating the arbitration agreement to be more specific about the procedures for resolving any disputes relating to your subscription and our services.
