Hi Bryant,
I’ve received recommendation requests from 9 schools (in addition to the 4 I received previously) since you sent the email below! It appears that the Cambridge deadline is also Dec. 1, but I can’t tell from some of the emails what the deadline is.  Can you please tell me right away the exact deadline for each of the schools?  Also, please confirm that they are all for master’s degrees (which appears to be the case).

Dr. Richardson,
 
Thanks for being willing to write me letters of recommendation. Hopefully you received a link to submit a letter from a few different schools. My first application is due December 1 at 3 pm (Harvard). I will open up the rest of my applications tonight so that you can submit all of them at the same time to make it easiest for you.
 
Here is some context to make it easier for you to write a good generalized letter:
I am interested in Machine Learning programs and would be most excited applying ML techniques to NLP problems. I am only applying to Masters programs rather than any PHDs. A couple schools have a good program in computational linguistics, but for the most part I am just applying to Data Science programs or even CS programs and then will do a “specialization” or “emphasis” in Machine learning, AI, or linguistics depending on the school. 
Here are a couple points that you may choose to highlight:
-          Diligent worker
-       Quick learner
-          Smart: Got an A in my class: CS 401R Machine Translation
-          He works well with others.
-          Bryant is reliable. 
-          Bryant is passionate about the material.
-          Bryant has grit and determination to put in extra hours to finish projects.
-          We covered various MT methods including rule-based, statistical, and Neural MT and built corresponding models
-          We covered data cleaning, and Bryant built a clean pipeline to clean any English-polish pair TMX files in preparation for training model.
-          We also covered gale church alignments, and evaluation metrics like Bleu and Comet.
-          Bryant’s final project was impressive, it was a complete multilingual neural MT model for English, Spanish, Polish, and Czech to evaluate a correlation between adding language family pairs to a MNMT and translation quality including zero-shot translation on untrained language pairs.
 
I also already sent you my resume for reference. Let me know if you need anything else from me. 
 
Thanks again,

To: bryant0918@gmail.com

Hello!
Thank you for starting your graduate application. We are so excited that you have taken your first official steps to being considered for admission to graduate school here at BYU! 
We have compiled the following tips to help you complete your application and ensure that it is processed in a timely manner.
	•	Applicant Portal - Please note that your Applicant Portal provides you with continuous updates and information related to your application status and decisions. We suggest that you check this portal often to address any action items that may prevent you from being admitted and/or to stay up to date with the latest communications.    
	•	BYU netID - This unique identifier is critical because it is tied to your student record and your ecclesiastical endorsement. If you recently applied to BYU and already have a netID but have forgotten it you can try to retrieve it here. However, if you created your netID before 2019 and have forgotten it you will need to reach out to our BYU Technical Support Center by phone at (801) 422-4000.  
	•	Test scores - If you had any official test scores (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS, E3PT etc.) sent to BYU prior to January 2020, you will need to let us know so we can manually match them with your application record.    
	•	Recommendations - Please note that you do not need to wait until all your letters of recommendation are received before you can submit your application. You also have the ability to remind your recommender to submit on the recommendations page.  Click "Edit", then "Send Reminder". You can even remove and add a different recommender by selecting 'Exclude.'  
	•	 Deadlines - Please remember that it is your responsibility to submit your application before the applicable application deadline for your graduate program. Do not wait until the last possible moment to submit your application!
We hope these tips have been helpful and look forward to reviewing your application soon.

Yes thank you, I don't know what happened there. It looks good now on my end and it shouldn't be a problem.

Just a reminder my first applications are due Wednesday, December 1 at 3 pm (Harvard). I am working on starting all the rest of my applications tonight so that you are free to submit all the letters at the same time tomorrow or Wednesday morning to make it easiest for you.

Here is some more context for you to know how to write a good generalized letter:
I am interested in Machine Learning programs and would be most excited applying ML techniques to NLP problems. I am only applying to Masters programs rather than any PHDs. A couple schools have a good program in computational linguistics, but for the most part I am just applying to Data Science programs or even CS programs and then will do a “specialization” or “emphasis” in Machine learning, AI, or linguistics depending on the school. 
Attached is a copy of my resume for reference.
Attached is also a letter of recommendation for you to edit to your heart's content.

Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.

-Bryant McArthur

I seek a private tutor for my daughter that just finished high school and about gaining admission into college. She needs a tutor in  Introductory Linear  Algebra.

Dear Bryant,
 
We wanted to follow up since we last contacted you regarding the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. Program at the University of Notre Dame. We hope that you have had a chance to examine our website. The application deadline is only a few days away, Dec 1, 2022.   We encourage you to take a closer look at IBMS and invite you to apply to the program with no application fee, by using the fee waiver code, "IBMS31". Further details about the faculty and research clusters, as well as an online application, can be found at http://ibms.nd.edu.   The IBMS Graduate Program is a cross-departmental Ph.D. program that organizes research and training thematically and allows students to explore research interests independent of departmental boundaries.  Notre Dame has excellent research facilities, including state-of-the-art instrumentation and laboratories. Our faculty are recognized leaders in their respective fields and appreciate the importance of providing graduate students individual attention so as to maximize their learning experience. The diversity of faculty research interests provides our students with a broad interdisciplinary background, and considerable choice and flexibility in class choices and research projects.   The current stipend for the 2022/2023 academic year is $34,428 for twelve-month appointments. The IBMS program covers the full stipend for the first year alleviating the need for first year students to accept teaching assistant positions. Graduate fellowships are available for incoming students and we subsidize the University of Notre Dame Student Health Insurance plan. Tuition costs, which currently amount to about $60,044, are paid in full by the Graduate School for all students in our program.  If you have any questions before completing and submitting your application, please contact me at ibms@nd.edu. For technical help submitting your application, please email gradapp@nd.edu.  We look forward to reading your application.  Kind regards,  Jeff Schorey Director, Integrated Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program Professor, Department of Biological Sciences University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, Indiana 46556

Yes those are the universities for which I've already opened up my application. I am going to open up the rest of them tonight. None of the applications will have a deadline sooner than Harvard's of 3 pm on December 1, however several applications allow recommenders to submit their letters after my application deadline. Here is a list of schools and deadlines I'm planning on applying for (I may add a couple more tonight). Hopefully you can just submit all of them at the same time after I open them tonight.

I don't know why Stanford showed up for you as Bryant Handshake, but Dr. Jarvis said the same thing. It definitely says Bryant McArthur now on my end.

Here is some context for you to help you write a good generalized letter:
I am interested in Machine Learning programs and would be most excited applying ML techniques to NLP problems. I am only applying to Masters programs rather than any PHDs. A couple schools have a good program in computational linguistics, but for the most part I am just applying to Data Science programs or even CS programs and then will do a “specialization” or “emphasis” in Machine learning, AI, or linguistics depending on the school. 
Here are also a few points that you may choose to highlight:
-          Diligent worker
-          Smart: Good grades and test scores in the most difficult program BYU has to offer. And 4.0 in the two classes he’s taken from me: Math 346 Mathematical Analysis, and Math 436 Model Dynamics & Control.
-       Quick learner
-          Constantly in the dedicated ACME room helping other individuals understand difficult concepts.
-          He works well with others and leads a separate study group to cover challenging material.
-          Bryant is reliable. I never have to worry about him failing to ask questinos when he doesn't understand a concept, or forgetting to turn in an assignment or project
-          Bryant seems passionate about the material.
-          Bryant knows how to manage his time well. Bryant is one of the few married students and he also has a 9 month old baby. Somehow Bryant manages to produce higher quality work in less time than many others to make it home in time for dinner with his wife and kid. 
-          But also has grit and determination to finish projects or study late for midterms
-          Math background will surely give him a unique edge in understanding material in your program.
 
Attached is also a copy of my resume for reference.
Thanks for doing this for me! I really appreciate it.

Here are the universities from which I have received requests for letters of recommendation for you — in case I have missed any.

Berkeley (no deadline indicated)

Harvard (deadline of Dec 1, 2022)

Stanford (no deadline indicated) — this one had the name of Bryant Handshake listed, so I am not completely sure this is for you.

I am preparing a letter of recommendation to submit to those universities with listed deadlines. What would be helpful for me is to have the deadlines for the remaining two universities.

The challenge this week is Be Kind. 
Specifically, that means taking some time each day to think about how the things we do, even small things, might be hurtful to others, and how we can change to serve and bless those people we may have previously hurt.   
Related to this challenge, and in preparation for our discussion on Professionalism and Belonging on Thursday, I encourage you to review the university policy on Diversity and Inclusion, below.
—Tyler Jarvis

Diversity and Inclusion in the Classroom
"Because we feel the depth of God's love for His children, we care deeply about every child of God, regardless of age, personal circumstances, gender, sexual orientation, or other unique challenges" (President Russell M. Nelson, "The Love and Laws of God," September 2019). As a university community we strive to foster an educational environment that promotes the personal dignity of every student and accept individual responsibility to eliminate racism, sexism, and nationalism.
Our course participation reflects our understanding that every individual is a child of Heavenly Parents. We create learning environments in which every individual is motivated to express their opinions and perspectives and ask questions to augment discussions and learning. We listen to, learn from, and strive to consider thoughtfully the opinions of others. We use language that is polite, considerate, and courteous—even when we strongly disagree.

All ACME Seniors,
Both the Gospel and professional workplace standards require us to treat everyone with respect and help everyone feel welcome, safe, and included.  This is especially important for us in ACME.  
Thursday December 1st we will have a required seminar about Belonging, Professionalism, and Respect. This will take place during regular lab time on Dec 1.  
	•	The lab for that day is extra short, to allow time for our discussion.
	•	We will require attendance in person for this discussion. For those who attend and participate, there will also be extra credit
	•	We will have a physical paper to sign at the time of the discussion to record attendance that determines the extra credit. It is not sufficient to fill out the online attendance quiz; this will be in addition to it. 
	•	We will provide kolaches (and a gluten-free alternative)
Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, especially in ACME. Our goal for this discussion is to help everyone learn to be more professional and considerate of others, to prepare you for life in the workplace, and to help make ACME a place where everyone feels respected, safe, and included.

Conditions of Carriage

Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example: 

• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.
• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.
• Our right to change terms of the contract.
• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.
• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.
• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight. 

Advice To Passengers On Limitations Of Liability

For international travel to or from another country, airline liability is governed by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention. There are no financial limits for death or bodily injury, and the airline may make an advance payment to cover immediate economic needs. The airline's liability for passenger delay, and for loss, delay or damage to baggage may be limited by the Conventions. In case of baggage, the liability limit is 1131 Special Drawing Rights (approximately US $1787) per passenger for international travel. The baggage limit is US $3,500 per ticketed passenger for US domestic travel. These baggage liability limitations apply unless you declare a higher valuation and pay additional charges at check-in. In case of international travel, any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of the actual or scheduled arrival of the aircraft; and, in case of baggage claims, written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in case of damage, and, in case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of the passenger. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.

Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:

If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (www.delta.com/appr) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.

Si l’embarquement vous est refusé, ou si votre vol est annulé ou retardé d’au moins deux heures ou si vos bagages sont perdus ou endommagés, vous pourriez avoir droit au titre du Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens, à certains avantages au titre des normes de traitement applicables et à une indemnité.

Confirmed. That looks good. I was thinking a flight out of gdansk would be good to end there but there isn’t anything non stop from gdansk to Athens so we can leave it how it is. It’s not too hard catching a train from gdansk to Warsaw.

The extra day in Athens will probably cost $200 for a room and food etc.

*You activated to earn 5% Cashback Bonus at Amazon.com and Digital Wallets from 10/1/22 (or the date on which you activate 5%, whichever is later) through 12/31/22, on up to $1,500 in purchases. Amazon.com purchases include those made through the Amazon.com checkout, like digital downloads, Amazon.com gift cards, Amazon Fresh orders, Amazon Local Deals, Amazon Prime subscriptions and items sold by third party merchants through Amazon.com's marketplace. Also includes in-store at Amazon Go, Amazon Bookstore, and Amazon 4-Star. Amazon, the Amazon.com logo, the smile logo, and all related marks are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates. Digital Wallet purchases include those made online and in-store with your smartphone, tablet, or wearable. Wallets that qualify include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and Garmin Pay. Using digital wallets to make purchases on Amazon.com will only earn a total of 5%. Listed merchants are in no way sponsoring or affiliated with this program. Purchases must be made with merchants in the U.S. To qualify for 5%, the purchase transaction date must be before or on the last day of the offer or promotion. For online purchases, the transaction date from the merchant may be the date when the item ships. Rewards are added to your account within two billing periods. Even if a purchase appears to fit in a 5% category, the merchant may not have a merchant category code (MCC) in that category. Merchants and payment processors are assigned an MCC based on their typical products and services. Discover Card does not assign MCCs to merchants. Certain third-party payment accounts and digital wallet transactions may not earn 5% if the technology does not provide sufficient transaction details or a qualifying MCC.

Hey y'all,
I am up to date through the end of chapter 4 on grading, and up through today on attendance. As we come close to the end of the semester sometimes we realize that grades are inconsistent between what we turned in what we were rewarded, or attendance points were taken when we were clearly present.
Before things get busy towards the end of the semester please take a look at your volume 3 grades (or all your classes) and make sure your homework is consistent with what you expect, and same for your reading quizzes and attendance. If you discover any discrepancies please let me know. If you have homework assignments you can prove you finished by the deadline but didn't submit then let me know and we can work something out. If you should have been marked present for attendance but weren't, let me know.
I cannot guarantee my leniency when I also get busy studying for finals, so earlier the better.
Happy Thanksgiving y'all!

Conditions of Carriage

Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example: 

• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.
• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.
• Our right to change terms of the contract.
• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.
• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.
• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight. 

Advice To Passengers On Limitations Of Liability

For international travel to or from another country, airline liability is governed by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention. There are no financial limits for death or bodily injury, and the airline may make an advance payment to cover immediate economic needs. The airline's liability for passenger delay, and for loss, delay or damage to baggage may be limited by the Conventions. In case of baggage, the liability limit is 1131 Special Drawing Rights (approximately US $1787) per passenger for international travel. The baggage limit is US $3,500 per ticketed passenger for US domestic travel. These baggage liability limitations apply unless you declare a higher valuation and pay additional charges at check-in. In case of international travel, any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of the actual or scheduled arrival of the aircraft; and, in case of baggage claims, written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in case of damage, and, in case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of the passenger. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.

Bryant,

Thanks. I'll share your email soon.

Yeah, it's a little silly to even have you guys test for collinearity with only two predictors, one of which is categorical, and their pairwise interaction. Just go ahead and report what the VIFs are and call it good.

I also have a question about the assignment due tonight. When we are supposed to test for multicollinearity it seems like the code in the html file you have up will only work for continuous variables. Is there an easy way in R to do it with our categorical variables?

I also feel like it's obvious though from our diagram that year and consonant are not collinear, and then obviously the interaction term "year:consonant" is dependent (partially collinear) with both year and consonant. Can I just say that or should I show the correlation matrix and/or VIF?

Dr. Brown,

Here is a way to better automate your feature selection through L1 - regularization. Mathematically it adds a term to the OLS equation to eliminate the coefficients of certain parameters that are collinear to create a better model.

Here are some helpful links to explain it in the context of "R":
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/lasso-regression-model-with-r-code/
https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/linear-lasso-and-ridge-regression-with-r
https://www.statology.org/lasso-regression-in-r/
https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/r4sl/regularization.html

The basic idea is that we add an extra term to OLS of: lambda*sum(abs(Bj)) where Bj corresponds to the jth coefficient.

We first test our model with a few different lambda values (generally c(.0001, .001, .01, .1, 1, 10, 100, 1000)) Finding an exact lambda is not important as long as we have the degree right. Then with the lambda value that gave us the best score we run the Lasso regression:

    la.eq <– glmnet(X, y, lambda=lambda,
                    family=“gaussian”,
                    intercept = F, alpha=1)

The alpha=1 is what determines this regression as Lasso (Or L1-normalization). 

You'll find that several coefficients corresponding to different features will now be 0.0 and you can run more accurate predictions.

Hi Bryant,
Yes, sorry about that, but the hosting took all my focus…  The only real times I have on Monday are from 9-9:30am  or 10-10:30am – would one of those work for you?  I’m leaving in the afternoon to fly out of town for the week.
Let me know.

Today's topic.
Nancy Pelosi. On Thursday, the California Democrat who made history as the first woman to be named Speaker of the House announced she was stepping down after 20 years as Democratic leader. Pelosi had served as the head of her party in Congress for two decades, and her decision ended one of the most powerful and long standing political careers in recent memory.
Pelosi, 82, made the announcement shortly after Democrats lost control of the House in this year's midterm elections, and just weeks after her husband Paul was assaulted inside their California home, an attack that required surgery for a fractured skull.
“When I first came to the [House] Floor at six years old, never would I have thought that someday I would go from homemaker to House Speaker," she said on the House floor. "For me, the hour’s come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect."
She also stated her intention to remain in Congress, saying the attack on her husband convinced her to stay. President Biden praised Pelosi as the "most consequential speaker" in the nation's history.
Pelosi first entered Congress in 1987, when her top priority was helping address the AIDS epidemic. She first took the leadership post for Democrats in 2002 to succeed Richard Gephardt, who stepped aside when Republicans took control of the House. She served as speaker from 2007 to 2011 and from 2019 to the present, and was the first speaker to lose and then regain the post in over 60 years. In 2010, after Democrats lost a wave of seats in the House, Pelosi defied critics by running for leadership again and managed to pull off the victory.
Her career was defined not just by the length of her stay at the top of the party, but by her central role passing the Affordable Care Act, leading Democrats as the opposition party against Donald Trump, and her ability to usher through two of the largest bills in U.S. history in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. She was also the most prolific fundraiser in the party's history, raising $310 million in this election cycle alone and, by some estimates, close to $1.3 billion during her 20 years in leadership. In 2020, she drew the ire of conservatives when she tore up then-President Trump's State of the Union address while sitting behind him.
Her announcement leaves the Democratic party with a power vacuum at the top, unsure of who will take the gavel for the first time in many years. Pelosi's longtime allies Steny Hoyer, the 83-year-old majority leader from Maryland, and James Clyburn of South Carolina, the 82-year-old No. 3 Democrat in the House, also announced they'd be stepping down from their leadership positions.
That leaves an opening for a fresh, young slate of Democratic leadership to enter the fray. New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a 52 year old lawmaker who could become the first Black leader of a major party in U.S. history, is the odds-on favorite to replace Pelosi as leader of the party. Pelosi said she has no plans to endorse a replacement.
Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is expected to face fierce opposition in his attempt to become the new Speaker of the House, the role Pelosi has served for the last four years.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions from the left and right, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left celebrate her as perhaps the greatest speaker in U.S. history.
	•	Some argue she guided Democrats through the most challenging moments of the last 20 years.
	•	Others praise her for keeping the party together, which outweighed any cons.
In Bloomberg, Jonathan Bernstein called her the greatest speaker of the House in history.
“Her four terms as speaker, two during unified Democratic government and two under Republican presidents and divided government, were unusually productive,” Bernstein said. “During President Barack Obama’s first term, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, she steered the Affordable Care Act into law. When her party operated with a fragile majority over the last two years, she somehow again found ways to pass liberal priorities, sometimes on party-line votes and sometimes with bipartisan support. None of this was assured... Pelosi proved to be a genius of process and people.
“If she brought something to the House floor, everyone knew she had the votes. Over and over again, she found creative ways to package the Democratic Party’s priorities in a manner that allowed something people thought was a lost cause to wind up on the president’s desk,” he added. “Most notably, she managed to save the Affordable Care Act when a filibuster-proof supermajority had evaporated in the Senate by adopting some components of the bill using a procedural maneuver known as reconciliation. More than a decade later, she drove a huge legislative agenda including a bipartisan infrastructure bill as well as the Inflation Reduction Act addressing climate change, health care and other priorities... All the procedure in the world can’t help if the votes aren’t there. But Pelosi would find a path when one wasn’t apparent.”
In The New York Times, Michelle Cottle said anyone who worked with Pelosi will remember her as a "total badass."
“By that term, I don’t mean that Ms. Pelosi is some swaggering, performative tough guy. Quite the opposite. In her two decades atop the House Democratic caucus, whether in the majority or the minority, she has been a strikingly effective leader in part because she doesn’t much give a flip about her public image,” Cottle wrote. “What matters to her is getting stuff done — be it passing legislation, thwarting the opposition’s agenda or protecting her members come election time. She is brutally pragmatic (too much so for some in her caucus) and has a shrewd sense of the political pressure points of allies and opponents alike. She doesn’t hog the credit for her clever ideas, nor does she waste time publicly rationalizing or blaming others for her bad ones. No one outworks her, and aides and allies have happily cultivated the legend of her endless energy. (Key points: Doesn’t need sleep. Runs on chocolate.)
“Ms. Pelosi has frequently been underestimated. It is one of her competitive advantages,” she said. “That whole grandmother-in-pearls thing led many to assume that she could be talked down to or outmaneuvered or intimidated. More than one Republican president and congressional leader has seen his best-laid plans shatter against her vaguely awkward, excessively bright smile. (Ms. Pelosi has never been natural in front of the camera.) Mr. Bush’s second-term goal of remaking Social Security never had a prayer. Even President Donald Trump was clearly in awe of her and had no idea how to deal with her treating him like a petulant man-child. He still doesn’t. The poor guy can’t even come up with an insulting nickname for her that sticks.”
In The Guardian, Moira Donegan said she was a "hate figure" for the right and left.
“To Republicans, Pelosi has long taken on a kind of mythic malice. To the Fox-watching white male, Pelosi symbolizes liberal elitism, a vague but totalizing specter of corruption, and that particular kind of liberal decadence that can be evoked by the name of the city that makes up nearly all of her longtime congressional district: San Francisco," Donegan wrote. "Which was always a bit of a stretch, because the fact of the matter is that the American left tends to hate Pelosi, too. To them, her two terms as speaker – first from 2007 to 2011, and then again from 2019 until this coming January – were eras of strictly enforced centrism. Under Pelosi’s tenure, the congressional agenda was kept well to the right of the base’s preferences, and leftist stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were needlessly sidelined.
“Neither of these understandings of Pelosi really capture the most striking aspect of her career – which has been characterized, above all, by an almost preternatural ability to discipline her caucus,” Donegan said. “Perhaps no speaker has been so successful at securing votes and cultivating the loyalties of her members; in interviews, Democratic House members speak of her with awe, like she’s something between a charismatic high school teacher and an emotionally withholding mom. This charisma is carefully cultivated: she famously tells no one her secrets, but has a long memory – both for past favors and past grievances. Some members seem to be eagerly seeking her approval. None seem willing to cross her.”

What the right is saying. 
	•	Many on the right acknowledge Pelosi's strengths as a politician, but criticize how she has changed the country.
	•	Some argue she spent too much money and criticize how she made partisanship worse.
	•	Others call out how little she worked across the aisle during her time in office.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board said Republicans who loathe Pelosi "can still learn from her how to effectively wield power."
"At her best, Mrs. Pelosi believes in American freedom and has no illusions about U.S. adversaries. This year she visited Ukraine and Taiwan, and she didn’t back down from the latter trip despite heavy pressure from China," the board said. "At her worst, Mrs. Pelosi is a petty partisan. Recall the 2020 State of the Union, when she tore up President Trump’s speech while he was standing in front of her. She put allies like Rep. Adam Schiff in charge of the Intelligence Committee and let him make wild claims about Trump-Russia collusion when it was politically useful. She insisted on impeaching Mr. Trump twice, though both times it strengthened him with GOP partisans.
"Yet there’s no denying that Mrs. Pelosi has been an effective House leader, the most powerful Speaker in decades. Were Republicans paying attention? In last week’s elections, the GOP regained the House, but its new majority will be as small as Mrs. Pelosi’s current one. The narrow margin next year calls for a strong Speaker and Republican unity. If the GOP wants to convince the electorate to give it a real mandate in 2024, it needs to show it can govern," the board said. "This week Kevin McCarthy won a party vote to be nominated as Speaker, 188-31, but he needs 218 votes in January... Mr. McCarthy’s majority will be 222 at most. That number was enough for Mrs. Pelosi to avoid pointless brinkmanship over the past two years and pass an ambitious agenda for Mr. Biden. Mr. McCarthy and Republicans could learn from the example."
In Spectator, Daniel Flynn said Pelosi lacked the ability to make deals with Republicans.
"She carried a big stick to beat mavericks in her own caucus into submission. She never wielded the olive branch to extend to the other party. A single House Republican voted for Obamacare, which numbered one more than the Republicans who voted for the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Her refusal to consider a more palatable Build Back Better Act resulted in a Democrat-controlled Senate refusing to pass it," Flynn wrote. "One does not expect a House leader to cave to the opposing party on their legislation. But Pelosi’s iron-fisted leadership that prevented all but a few Democrats from crossing the aisle to support much of the major legislation advanced by Republican presidents generally meant no concessions to Democrats and laws more extreme than ones in which both parties took a role in crafting.
"An extreme woman influenced our politics to move further to the poles. While whipping a caucus into uniformity speaks to talents as a disciplinarian, the almost complete absence in her record of persuading and cajoling the other side to support the bills that Democrats championed indicates a glaring failure in the one skill typically associated with great legislators," he added. "Her two immediate predecessors as Democratic House leaders, Dick Gephardt and Tom Foley, both lived in districts that contained enough Republicans to make elections not foregone conclusions. Pelosi represents the ninth-bluest district in the United States (and the fourth wealthiest). If you live in a city that bans Happy Meals and tears down statues of Ulysses S. Grant, then your sense of the middle likely veers far from it."
In The New York Post, John Podhoretz said Pelosi's legacy is that she has spent a colossal amount of money.
"Her own contributions to this country on matters of policy, rather than shepherding or opposing bills in the House, have been negligible. She was impotent when it came to dealing with an anti-Semitic outbreak in her caucus in 2019, for example," he wrote. "And she descended into childishness to match her target’s behavior when she ripped up Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech as she sat behind him in 2020. But fair is fair. She has proved herself a political technician of immense skill. And if you like the game of politics, you have to enjoy someone who plays it masterfully even if she’s on a team you dislike.
"It was Pelosi, who became speaker 12 years later, who figured out how to herd the House’s cats and make the body into a weapon for progressivism. In 2009 and 2010, Pelosi forcefully subordinated the individual interests of her party’s members to the national interest of the Obama administration and prevailed upon Democrats in conservative districts to vote for ruinously expensive and statist regulations," Podhoretz said. "And when Joe Biden became president — after Trump screwed things up again for Republicans by helping Democrats win the Senate in the Georgia runoffs in 2020 — she painted her masterpiece. With an incredibly scant majority in the House, she managed to help Biden secure around $5 trillion in new spending in just 20 months’ time.

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	There is no doubt Pelosi is a historic figure who was good at her job.
	•	There is also a good argument she made Congress more dysfunctional and partisan.
	•	You can respect her political acumen and also call out the deeply concerning elements of her time in office. 
Writing about someone as divisive as Nancy Pelosi in this newsletter is not easy. So, in the interest of fairness, I'll try to make it crystal clear both what I appreciate about her and what I think her biggest faults are.
For starters, there's no doubt she was a barrier-breaking figure. The "first Madame speaker" came to Congress directly on the heels of being a stay-at-home mother of five, a story that — even now — is vanishingly rare in our politics. But framing Pelosi in these terms is reductive and diminishing. Even if she had been a man who had taken the typical route to the top of the chamber, her career would have been remembered as one of the most significant in the history of U.S. politics.
If you talk to any Democratic politician, strategist or donor, they all say the same: She was prolific. Good at her job. A menace. Iron fisted. She kept the party in line and got what she wanted. Ushering in the Affordable Care Act is a good example (go read Obama’s memoir if you want to know how critical she was), but there are dozens of others. Like Mitch McConnell in the Senate, she is hated by her opposition precisely because she was such a shrewd and ruthless political operator. And if you talk to Republican politicians, especially off the record (which I have), they'll say the same thing about Pelosi: Smart, effective, incredible power over her chamber. They may not like her, sure, but many of them concede they admire her off the record (some say it quite loudly on the record).
One of my favorite moments during the Trump presidency was when we got a rare, real-time look at how Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) were negotiating. The press was present for a debate the four had on border security and the potential for a government shutdown, and despite the presence of Schumer and Vice President Mike Pence, it was clear the conversation was really between Pelosi and Trump. Throughout the exchanges, Trump and Pelosi went toe-to-toe in front of the cameras. Trump insisted he wouldn't keep the government open without funding for the wall, and the government did indeed shut down. But Pelosi held the caucus together, called his bluff and he ultimately signed a stopgap funding bill she whipped through the House without border wall funding.
Those were the days when Trump would say things like this about her: "She works very hard, she's worked long and hard, and I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished." More recently, Trump has called her "an animal" who is "incapable of doing deals" and said she was a "nasty, vindictive, horrible person." But back then, Pelosi was a formidable opponent to a man famous for owning the room. Like her or not, this is who she was as speaker, and how she'll be remembered by her supporters (and detractors). At this point, these things are basically indisputable about her.
She was also deeply flawed. Putting her politics aside — we could write a whole edition on the pros and cons and as you might expect, she's fought for some stuff I like and some stuff I do not — my two biggest beefs with the soon-to-be-former speaker are that she has made Congress a less deliberative and more dysfunctional body, and she and her family have unethically gotten rich off of her position of power.
On the former, she continued and accelerated the long-term trend of leadership gobbling up power from rank and file members. She's pushed forward a new kind of Congress where bills are negotiated, crafted and agreed to by leadership and then shoved down the throats of the members in their caucus, only for tweaks to be made after the fact to win votes or browbeat people into submission. This kind of legislating has taken real power not just from representatives, but from the voters who put them there, and Pelosi has helped perfect it.
This is a critical part of her legacy, and it is one that has made our Congress worse. The House is worse off today because of it, which means the Senate is negotiating and passing bills that are less representative of the country as a whole. And now a whole new generation of Democratic leadership that worships her is going to come into power trying to emulate how she did things.
As for her exorbitant wealth, it's still more smoke than fire, but there is a lot of smoke. Pelosi's wealth has grown by $140 million since she took office thanks to the trades made by her husband Paul Pelosi, many of which coincided with major congressional decisions. Their unbelievable success in the stock market has become so legendary that there are entire websites dedicated to tracking the family's trades so retail investors can shadow them, often with great success. It's almost farcical at this point, despite Pelosi denying she has ever tipped her husband off. Not surprisingly, Pelosi was extremely resistant to bipartisan efforts to ban congressional stock trading, a terrible look for the party and for her.
But this is who she is. Tough, smart, a tactical, political technician. Power-hungry, out of touch, and maybe even corrupt. She has undoubtedly left her mark on Congress and on U.S. politics. I'd bet everything I own there will one day be a Congressional building named after her and dozens of books written on her time. But if you were paying attention, her legacy is just as complicated as it is notable.

Your questions, answered.
Today, I'm doing something a little different. During our election coverage, I answered a reader question about funding in the 2022 cycle. Richard from Affton, Missouri, asked why Democrats had so much more funding. The broad stroke of my response was that they didn't — Republicans outfunded them in plenty of races.
Richard followed up, noting that my answer dealt specifically with overall spending that included outside groups and primaries, while his question was specifically about candidate fundraising — where Republicans were outspent in Senate races in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina and New Hampshire. After clarifying, Richard asked again why Republicans were outspent across the board:
Q: During the general election, why did so many Republican candidates have such a funding disparity compared to their Democratic counterparts in the competitive states?
Tangle: I think the answer to your more specific inquiry is also straightforward. In short, many of the inexperienced candidates with the widest funding gaps (like Blake Masters in Arizona) actually failed to raise much money on their own initially, which is something that compounds over time. That led to Republican leadership, like Mitch McConnell, to make tough decisions about which races to invest money, time or resources in.
Funny enough, the Associated Press just dropped an entire piece about this and some of the infighting that has ensued. But key to the whole thing, in my view, is that the candidates themselves failed to raise enough money early on. Democratic candidates outraised Republicans nearly 2-to-1 in battleground states. My best guess is there are three main reasons for this:
	•	Democratic voter enthusiasm in battleground states was high
	•	Trump hogging most of the party's donations, since so many people in the base will now only donate to him
	•	Weakness and inexperience of the candidates, who didn’t focus enough on fundraising and weren’t compelling enough to pull big money from voters
In Arizona, for instance, Masters was out fundraised by an 8-to-1 margin, then blamed McConnell (who spent $232 million across the Senate races) for not funding his campaign. But if you're McConnell and you see that, it’s easy to interpret the data as meaning Masters didn't have a chance. He lost pretty handily, so McConnell may have been smart not to back him.
One other reason for the disparity: When a candidate buys TV advertising space, they get the best deals on those ads. That means candidate money gets cheaper ad space than Super PAC money. So Democratic candidates who raised lots of money could buy television ads for a lower cost and then raise more money through the ads, meaning that virtuous cycle could build on itself.

Under the radar.
A former anti-abortion leader is alleging that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito once leaked the outcome of a decision he had drafted before it was public. Rev. Rob Schenck says he was told the outcome of the 2014 Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case three weeks before it was released, and shared emails from that time with The New York Times to support his claim. The revelation has drawn new speculation about Alito's possible role in the leak of the decision to strike down Roe v. Wade to POLITICO, a story that is still being investigated by the court. The New York Times has the story.

Numbers.
	•	18. The number of terms Nancy Pelosi has served as a member of Congress, totaling 35 years.
	•	83.9%. The percentage of the vote she won in her last race for Congress in California's 11th District.
	•	47. Pelosi's age when she won her first seat in Congress.
	•	82. Pelosi's age today.
	•	60%. The percentage of U.S. voters who said they wanted to see Pelosi step down from her leadership post.
	•	49%. The percentage of Democrats who said she should remain House leader.

Have a nice day. 
A horse in Utah has returned home after eight years of running around with wild mustangs. Shane Adams said his horse Mongo had been missing from home for eight years — a time period in which he went through a divorce, lost his home, and suffered a traumatic brain injury. But in September, he finally received some good news: His horse Mongo had returned. Adams had been riding almost his entire life but never felt a bond with any horse like the one he had with Mongo. He had alerted the Bureau of Land Management about the missing horse. And then a worker there suspected she had wrangled a domesticated horse during a gathering in Dugway Proving Ground, eventually recognizing him from Adams' notices and reaching out. Fox 9 has the story.

It's abortion, stupid.
BY ISAAC SAUL – 18 NOV 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
 
The current state of the U.S. House race, according to a map from Cook Political Report. 
This is a preview of today's Friday edition. To read the entire thing, you'll have to become a Tangle member. 
If this is your first time reading Tangle, you can sign up for our mailing list here.

Let's start with a baseline understanding: What happened last week was not normal.
We touched on it in all of our election coverage, but Democrats performed historically well. It was the best midterm showing for a party that controlled the White House in 20 years, and one of the best we've seen in the last 100 years.
More interesting, though, is why Democrats performed better than we expected, and why Republicans under-performed. After all, the fundamentals seemed to be going one way: Biden is unpopular, inflation is raging, a major war is happening in Europe, dissatisfaction with the country is very high, violent crime is up, and almost every first-term president loses a lot of political power in Congress following midterms.
As Alex Shephard put it before the election: "The truth is that midterms are nearly as predictable as death and taxes: The party that controls the White House always loses and often badly at that."
But instead, Democrats secured their Senate majority, are favorites to pick up a Senate seat, and appear to have just barely lost control of the House — losing somewhere between six and ten seats, rather than the thirty, forty, or even sixty seats that were predicted.
Since the election, I've seen (roughly) five popular theories attempt to explain these surprise results: Candidate quality, inaccurate polls, concerns over democracy, the youth vote actually turning out, and abortion rights.
Below, I'm going to summarize each of them, with bits of other people's arguments, to give you an idea of the leading theories.
Obviously, the headline of this newsletter gives away my position. So at the end, I’ll make the case for why I think abortion rights was the primary driver of these results, and also try to rebut some of the following arguments.

1) Candidates matter.
One prominent theory is that candidates matter. This idea is best explained by noting that Republicans had a generic ballot advantage on Democrats going into the election, appear poised to win a popular vote majority in the House races, but will ultimately do much worse than expected across the country.

Hi All,
The quiz this week was supposed to open tomorrow after class, but I had the wrong date entered, so many of you have already taken it. However, we haven't covered Thursday's class material yet, so you couldn't have known the answers to questions 2-4, so I'm going to make it so any answer gets full credit for those questions. It is now open till Friday for those who haven't done it yet.

Dear current and former students from my CS 401R class as well as others I’ve talked with about machine translation,
For any of you (all of you?) who are seriously interested in MT, I strongly recommend attending this seminar.  Alon Lavie is very well know and highly respected in the MT community.  He led the development of the METEOR metric (a response to BLEU!) and COMET, which those who have taken 401R will be familiar with. He was also the head of MT at Amazon for several years, and has worked on adaptive and low-resource MT.
I hope to see you there!

Hello everyone!
 
Here's the information on this week's seminar speaker: 
 
Title:  The COMET Universe: Establishing an AI Ecosystem for Translation Quality Evaluation
 
Presenter:  Alon Lavie: VP of Language Technologies, Unbabel 
and Consulting Professor, Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.
 
Abstract:
The AI neural revolution of recent years has resulted in dramatic improvements in the performance and accuracy of Machine Translation (MT) systems.  Commercial MT services translate billions of words every day, and the vast majority of translated content for both enterprises and governments are now generated using MT, edited by humans.  This progress has largely been enabled and driven by a new generation of vastly-improved translation quality evaluation technologies. In this talk, I will describe and review these underlying technologies, within the context of a long-term R&D initiative at Unbabel for establishing and developing an ecosystem for Translation Quality Evaluation.  I will highlight some of the exciting new capabilities and opportunities enabled by our emerging ability to identify translation errors and accurately measure translation quality.
 
Speaker Bio:
Alon Lavie is the VP of Language Technologies at Unbabel, a US/Portugal-based translation technology and services company, where he leads and manages Unbabel's US AI lab in Pittsburgh, and provides strategic leadership for Unbabel's AI R&D teams company-wide.  Concurrently, he is a Consulting (adjunct) Professor at the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where he has been a member of the faculty since 1996.  His primary research interests and activities focus on Machine Translation (MT) and on MT Evaluation. He directed and led the ten year development (2004-2014) of the METEOR automated MT evaluation metric. More recently, while at Unbabel, he directed the development of a new neural framework for MT evaluation named COMET, and a complementary tool for MT quality analysis named MT-Telescope. His other main research interests focus on MT adaptation approaches with and without human feedback, applied to both high-resource language pairs as well as low-resource and minority languages. Additional interests include translation Quality Estimation, and methods for multi-engine MT system combination.  He served as the President of the International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT) (2013-2015). Prior to that, he was president of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) (2008-2012), where he continues to serve as a consultant to the Executive Board. He is also a member of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), where he was president of SIGParse - ACL's special interest group on parsing (2008-2013). In August 2021, at the 18th biennial Machine Translation Summit conference, he was awarded the 2021 Makoto Nagao IAMT Award of Honour for his contributions to the field of Machine Translation.

Today's topic.
Former President Trump. Last night, former President Donald Trump officially announced his plans to run for president again in 2024. Just hours before, he also filed the requisite campaign paperwork. This will be Trump’s third bid for the White House, and he has the opportunity to become just the second president to win two nonconsecutive terms (the first was Grover Cleveland, in 1884 and 1892).
During the announcement, which took place in front of about 1,000 attendees at Mar-a-Lago, Trump laid out the case for his campaign. He criticized the Biden administration for historic inflation, a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the increase in gas prices, lack of control at the southern border, and an increase in violent crime. Describing Biden as the "face of left-wing failure," Trump promised to unleash American energy, crack down on drugs and crime, reinstate his "Remain in Mexico" policy, and fight the Republican establishment and "deep state."
His speech was a mix of American carnage and calls for hope. He described "blood-soaked" streets full of crime, warned of an "invasion" by unknown unauthorized immigrants, and promised to institute the death penalty for drug dealers. He simultaneously called for a movement of "love" and "hope," inviting both Democrats and Republicans to join him in an effort to take the country back from the Biden administration.
Notably absent from Trump's speech was any mention of abortion, an issue many pollsters believe helped drive Democrats to their historic success in the 2022 midterms. Trump also gave a hearty endorsement to Herschel Walker, the Republican Senate candidate heading for a runoff in Georgia, pleading with voters to hit the polls and support his campaign.
Trump's family and several political allies attended the announcement event, and at one point he asked both his son, Eric Trump, and his wife Melania to stand for acknowledgement. Ivanka Trump, the former president's high-profile daughter and former advisor, did not attend and has said she plans to remain out of the political fray to focus on her family (Jared, Ivanka's husband, was in the audience). Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), one of Trump's staunchest allies in the soon-to-be Republican-controlled House, also skipped the event, citing poor weather in the Washington D.C. area.
Trump, who has falsely asserted that the 2020 election was stolen from him and whose first term ended with the January 6 riots at the capitol, will be running a much different campaign than he did in 2020.
Many of his top allies, including his former Vice President Mike Pence, several former chiefs of staff, and a host of right-wing media pundits, have abandoned his campaign. Two of his top mega donors from the last two campaigns — Stephen A. Schwarzman and Ken Griffin —  have said they won't support him this time around. He is the subject of multiple state and federal investigations. The Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, Fox News and New York Post, which drive so much conservative commentary, seem cool on a Trump presidency. Finally, unlike 2020, Trump is expected to be challenged by other members of the Republican party in a primary.
Now that Trump's hat is in the ring, the next question is who that challenger may be. All eyes are currently on Ron DeSantis, who won his race for Florida governor in dominant fashion and has been showered in praise by the Republican establishment since. Trump has been criticizing DeSantis since election night, insisting he was disloyal for not having already bowed out of a 2024 run. On Monday, DeSantis responded to those criticisms.
"You take incoming fire, that's just the nature of it," he said. “All that is just noise....at the end of the day, I would just tell people to check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night."
Trump's announcement comes on the heels of a surprisingly poor midterm performance for Republicans, for which various factions of the party blamed either Trump or the establishment GOP. The most recent polls suggest Trump will be a favorite to win the Republican primary and a competitive candidate against President Biden if he decides to run for re-election. Just before the midterm elections, The Wall Street Journal polled 1,500 registered voters and found Trump and Biden in a dead heat, each with 46% of the vote.
Right after the midterms, a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 47% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents would vote for Trump in a Republican presidential primary, while 33% would vote for DeSantis. No other candidate got above 5% in the poll, while former Vice President Mike Pence got exactly 5%.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions to Trump's announcement from the left and right, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left say America deserves better than Trump, and insist he has proven himself to be unfit for office.
	•	Some suggest the announcement was "low energy" by Trump standards, and point to challenges for him ahead.
	•	Others predict Republicans will fall in line and support him even if the party is starkly divided right now.
The New York Times editorial board said "America deserves better than Donald Trump."
"As president, he showed himself to be incompetent and self-dealing. He should have been convicted by the Senate in 2019 for abusing his power and in 2021 for inciting an insurrection. Voters repudiated him at the ballot box after his second campaign, but he has the legal right to try again, so Americans must weather the trial of a third candidacy," the board said. "If he is still in the race when the first votes are cast in 2024, the election will once again be a referendum on American democracy, because if our system of government is to survive, voters must choose leaders who accept and submit to the rule of law... Legal proceedings against Mr. Trump and investigations related to his actions around Jan. 6, election interference in Georgia and his mishandling of classified information at his home in Florida also need to continue.
"His rise to power was built on the idea that he is a winner and, for many Republicans, his victory in 2016 was sufficient justification for having supported him. It allowed the party to cut taxes and take firm control of the Supreme Court, opening an era of conservative jurisprudence, including the reversal of Roe v. Wade this year," the board said. "But Republicans, even those who share Mr. Trump’s views on issues like China, trade and immigration, should recognize that it is shortsighted to pursue such goals by undermining the integrity of the political process. If Americans doubt the legitimacy of elections and their leaders fuel and inflame those doubts, they will no longer accept the legitimacy of decisions or policies of the federal government that contradict their views."
In MSNBC, James Downie called it a "shockingly low energy" announcement.
"Trump’s announcement Tuesday didn't have a backlit entrance or a bizarre descent on an escalator. Instead, it was perhaps, to borrow a Trump phrase, the most 'low energy' speech of his career," Downie said. "Minute after minute, he droned on. 'This is something I don't need,' he admitted at one point, 'and a lot of you people don’t need, either.' After nearly 40 minutes, perhaps sensing how bored his audience was, he urged them to sit down. Even Fox News cut away. 'We’re going back to President Trump,' said host Laura Ingraham, 'when news warrants.' It wasn't just Trump's tired delivery that made the speech so boring.
"It was the fact that there was nothing new: no real policies to fight inflation, no long-awaited pivot to the center. 'Cheating' in the 2020 election, the 'invasion' at the border, Hillary Clinton's emails, 'globalists' — all the old hits were played, and most of the dog whistles were blown," Downie said. "Trump's commitment to staying the course is mildly surprising only because the GOP’s midterm disappointments mean many in the party have the knives out for him... But it’s no surprise Trump is trotting out the same old trash. The core of his appeal, after all, includes a refusal to admit failure."
In Salon, Amanda Marcotte said Republicans will fall in line for Trump, just like they always do.
"The elite Republican failure to fathom Trump's entirely predictable behavior is perhaps understandable," she wrote. "After all, it's a group of people who don't know themselves very well, which is why they spent a week laboring under the delusion that they're just about ready to stand up to Trump, in recognition of all the damage he's done to them or their party. But if there is one thing as inevitable as Trump's Tuesday announcement, it's that the Republican establishment will come crawling back to him, each supposed leader more eager than the last to prostrate themselves before a man who views them with utter and undisguised contempt. We know this because the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
"For more than six years, Republican leaders have shown there's nothing Trump can say or do that will result in their turning on him," she wrote. "After Trump defended the neo-Nazis who rioted in Charlottesville in 2017, Republicans responded by embracing a more overt form of racism. After Trump led Republicans to heavy losses in the 2018 midterms, they doubled down by running even more overtly MAGA candidates. After Trump was impeached for trying to extort the president of Ukraine, a major U.S. ally, Republicans refused to convict him. When Trump started pressuring Republicans to risk prison to help him steal the 2020 election, they made excuses for him. When Trump sent a murderous crowd after his vice president and members of Congress on Jan. 6, Republicans shielded him from consequences."

What the right is saying.
	•	The right is divided on Trump, with some warning he is still a force to be reckoned with.
	•	Some say the media is making the same mistakes they made in 2016 by dismissing his candidacy.
	•	Others argue that despite some success, Trump has repeatedly failed the party, and the party must move on.
In The Federalist, Tristan Justice said Washington should be careful not to make the same mistakes they did six years ago.
"Trump might have been a wrecking ball in 2016, but there were still plenty of barriers to wreck. Another popular governor of Florida once entered the race as the front-runner. Leading the polls through the summer of 2015, former Gov. Jeb Bush, a seeming heir to the White House from a family that had already held it for three terms, entered the 2016 contest with $100 million on hand," Justice wrote. "While Trump had been written off as a 'comic book villain,' however, Bush dropped out after the South Carolina primary, and Trump carried the title of president-elect 10 months later... The lesson from 2016 is that Trump is not to be underestimated, no matter how dire his chances of claiming the presidency seem among the Washington establishment and particularly the Republican elite.
"Trump remains a dominant figure in the party, with a core of supporters who will be hard to turn away from someone they see as a crusader for the common people despite every force against him. In his announcement on Tuesday, Trump reminded voters how the country had improved under his leadership," Justice wrote. "He reminded Americans they could afford their gasoline and groceries on the same paycheck, that their southern border was in check, and that they were safe from a nuclear Armageddon, 'a concept unimaginable just two years ago.'... Trump wasn’t just written off in 2016. He and his voters were dismissed with elitist contempt, and it’s already repeating itself."
National Review's editors said simply: "No."
“A bruised Donald Trump announced a new presidential bid on Tuesday night, an invitation to double down on the outrages and failures of the last several years that Republicans should reject without hesitation or doubt,” the editors wrote. “To his credit, Trump killed off the Clinton dynasty in 2016, nominated and got confirmed three constitutionalist justices, reformed taxes, pushed deregulation, got control of the border, significantly degraded ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and cinched normalization deals between Israel and the Gulf states, among other things. These are achievements that even his conservative doubters and critics — including NR — can acknowledge and applaud. That said, the Trump administration was chaotic even on its best days because of his erratic nature and lack of seriousness.
“He often acted as if he were a commentator on his own presidency, and issued orders on Twitter and in other off-the-cuff statements that were ignored. He repeatedly had to be talked out of disastrous ideas by his advisers and Republican elected officials,” they said. “He turned on cabinet officials and aides on a dime. Trump had a limited understanding of our constitutional system, and at the end of the day, little respect for it. His inability to approximate the conduct that the public expects of a president undermined him from beginning to end. The latter factor played an outsized role in his narrow defeat to a feeble Joe Biden in 2020 in what was a winnable race. Of course, unable to cope with the humiliation of the loss, he pursued a shameful attempt to overturn the result of the election.”
In PJ Media, Victoria Taft said Trump put Democrats on notice.
"Trump told the charged-up crowd that the race is 'not about politics, it’s about our great love for this country.' He said that under Joe Biden 'we are a failing nation, a nation in decline' and that the Left’s platform is a 'platform of ruin.' Indeed, he said, his candidacy is a move to 'make [America] great and glorious again.' Trump mentioned the troubles with China and 'the China virus'; the Kim Jong Il meeting, which halted his missile testing; deals with the G-20 partners; and the energy crisis created by Biden’s failure to exploit our own energy sources. In a softened almost chastened-sounding tone, Trump used his big moment to encourage support for Hershel Walker in his Georgia Senate runoff race and gave a big shout-out to Kevin Kiley, who won his California congressional race in Gavin Newsom’s district,” she wrote.
"With the win, Kiley became the 218th Republican elected to the House, giving control over the House of Representatives to the GOP," Taft added. "Trump’s candidacy may be a big surprise or a big bust. One thing’s for sure: Trump is challenging his detractors to bring it on. And he would know what that’s like. He’s had the entire phalanx of media and the rest of the Democrats accuse him of being everything from a Russian spy to a rapist. Trump knows the worst the Democrats can conjure up is coming straight at him. I don’t care what you think of Donald Trump, the dude’s got guts. We need guts like that in public life. I wish more had that gift... The long knives are out. Let the race begin."

My take.

	•	Trump definitely enters the race as the favorite.
	•	He is far weaker now than he was in 2016 or 2020.
	•	A lot can happen in two years. 
Well, we all knew it was coming, and it came.
Trump made no secret about his intentions, and I never really doubted he would run. In fact, in my subscribers-only "19 predictions about the future," which I published in December of 2021, number three was that "Donald Trump will run for president in 2024." Number six was that "Ron DeSantis will be the 2024 Republican nominee." (Editor's note: eight of my 19 predictions have been settled, and so far I've gotten six right and two wrong).
I've probably watched more Trump speeches than just about any living person since 2015, and last night was a familiar one. Blood, guts, glory and redemption. He framed the country as in ruin, our adversaries as unafraid, President Biden as weak and asleep at the wheel, and pointed to threats from every corner (invasions on the border, blood in the streets, nuclear bombs in the skies). Then he promised to bring back glory and love and unity, calling on all patriots to join him. It's a consistent song that he has sung. Before reading any takes from the pundits who have echoed this sentiment, I also thought it was both predictable and surprisingly low energy. He seemed buttoned up and even-keeled, not raucous and angry.
In typical Trump fashion, he was boastful. He accomplished a lot of what he promised, and he was unafraid to go down the list: Tax cuts, border security, military spending, job gains, wage growth, and low gas prices. In typical Trump fashion, he also exaggerated and lied: He claimed to oversee "decades'' of no war (he was in office for four years, and there were wars), that our strategic oil reserves were "almost empty" (they're down about 30% since he was in office, and they were higher in Obama's term than they were in his), that his border wall was finished (it never got close) and that his tax cuts were the largest in history (by different measures, they were smaller than Reagan's in 1981 and Obama's in 2012).
In re-painting the last two years as an apocalyptic failure, Trump also repeatedly framed the end of his term as a prosperous period of peace, insisting that he handed over a country and economy to President Biden that simply needed to stay the course. On the contrary, the end of Trump's term was actually tremendously turbulent with the arrival of Covid-19 and then the riots at the Capitol, and the idea that Biden inherited a smoothly running country with a thriving economy is a delusion.
It was a divided country, on the heels of an unprecedentedly turbulent transfer of power, and an economy that, while growing, was severely fractured. Unemployment had skyrocketed due to the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of people had died from or with Covid-19, inflation was showing its first signs, and the global economy was hampered by supply chain issues.
And yet, as of this writing, Trump is still the most popular politician in the party, and I think he is the unquestioned favorite heading into the primaries. Ron DeSantis may have had a good week, but Trump has had six years of building out a base — some 30% to 40% of the Republican party — that is going to support him no matter what. He has a full war chest, the media's attention, and the acquiescence of major party players. He is the top dog until someone takes it from him, and I don't see that happening quite yet.
As I've said before, from talking to thousands of voters and reading hundreds of polls over the last few years, I think the number one reason Trump lost in 2020 was that people were exhausted. They were tired of him, of the bad news, of Covid-19, of all the noise and stress and upheaval. Even his most ardent supporters told me they had become exhausted defending his comments and tweets, or tired of having to defend themselves for supporting something he had done (if you are reading this and voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, I'd love to hear what you're thinking about 2024 — reply to this email and let me know).
He is also significantly weaker than he was in 2016. When Trump came into office, Republicans had 54 Senate seats, 247 House seats and 33 governorships. They lost the House in 2018, then lost the Senate in 2020 (in part thanks to Trump's antics around the election and failing to rally voters for the Georgia runoffs). This year, they blew a chance for huge gains in governorships, the Senate, and the House, and Trump's handpicked candidates and personal unpopularity definitely played a role. They will now have 49 or 50 Senate seats (a guaranteed Senate minority) along with about 220 House seats (a razor-thin majority) with just 25 governorships and huge losses at the state level.
If Republicans can't win governorships and Senate seats in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin during the midterms, with an unpopular president in office and inflation roaring, I have a hard time seeing Trump carrying those states in 2024. In 2016, the party almost exclusively lined up behind him. We're two years out from 2024, but former Trump voters, donors and supporters are already insisting they won't back him again.
We should remember 2016, and not underestimate Trump's appeal. But we would also do well not to pretend 2016 and 2024 are the same. This time, millions of Americans have already gotten to experience a Trump presidency, and many of them didn't like it.
Of course, this is just to describe things as they stand now. Remember how much the political narrative has changed just in the last week?
A lot can happen in two years.

2024 poll. 
I'm very curious where voters stand right now after the 2022 midterms — and especially where Tangle readers stand. So, I've created a fun little survey to find out (and maybe we can track this for the next couple of years).
If you’re an American voter and have two minutes, it's pretty short. This is not a scientific poll, just a way to take Tangle readers' temperature. You can take the poll here.

Under the radar. 
A federal judge has blocked the Biden administration from expelling migrants at the border without having their asylum claims heard. The administration has been trying to employ Title 42, a Trump-era policy instituted during Covid-19, to quickly deport migrants who arrive at the border claiming asylum. Biden said he would end the policy earlier this year, but a judge in a separate case blocked its termination. Now, a separate lawsuit — filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — makes the case that Title 42 violated the law and Biden should not be able to use it. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan agreed. Axios has the story.

Numbers. 
	•	65%. Among all voters surveyed by Morning Consult, the percentage that said Trump should probably or definitely not run.
	•	66%. Among all voters surveyed by Morning Consult, the percentage that said President Biden should probably or definitely not run in 2024.
	•	26%. The percentage of Republicans who said they would back Ron DeSantis in a Republican primary before the 2022 midterms.
	•	33%. The percentage of Republicans who said they would back Ron DeSantis after the 2022 midterms.
	•	~$100 million. The amount of money Donald Trump has on hand for his campaign, according to recent filings.

Have a nice day. 
This morning, NASA's Artemis 1 successfully launched on the agency's fourth attempt to send the most powerful rocket it has ever created around the moon. The uncrewed spacecraft is headed on a 25-day 1.3 million mile journey. The mission is the first to use the new Orion rocket that NASA believes will help it push farther into space. “What an incredible sight to see NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft launch together for the first time. This uncrewed flight test will push Orion to the limits in the rigors of deep space, helping us prepare for human exploration on the Moon and, ultimately, Mars,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. NASA has the details.

I just got this from a BYU almuna and friend of ACME, Rebecca Jones, at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory:

My group, AI and Data Analytics, at PNNL is hiring for interns, and recent graduates, next summer. The ACME students would be good candidates, and there haven't been a lot of applications yet. 
As far as I know, internships can be virtual or on-site, depending on the project, and a lot of interns get papers or a finished project from their internship.
Would you pass on the job postings?

The challenge this week (and next, since it's a short week) is "Give Thanks."  
Find one thing each day you are thankful for and share that with someone else or write it down somewhere.  The ACME Slack Workspace is a great place to do that.  
President Nelson does a better job than I do of explaining why giving thanks is so beneficial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i51gcWCs-Ho&t=120s
I am very thankful for all of you wonderful and amazing ACME students.   You bless my life and you inspire and motivate me to do better every day.

Subject: P.S. about CS Seminar Speaker on MT this week!
Date: November 14, 2022 at 4:42:33 PM MST
To: <srichardson@cs.byu.edu>

P.S. I’m going to schedule an informal lunch (maybe pizza?) at noon where you could come an ask questions or just talk with Dr. Lavie. It would be great to have you come. Please let me know if you can attend.  Thanks!

Dear current and former students from my CS 401R class as well as others I’ve talked with about machine translation,
For any of you (all of you?) who are seriously interested in MT, I strongly recommend attending this seminar.  Alon Lavie is very well know and highly respected in the MT community.  He led the development of the METEOR metric (a response to BLEU!) and COMET, which those who have taken 401R will be familiar with. He was also the head of MT at Amazon for several years, and has worked on adaptive and low-resource MT.
I hope to see you there!

Hello everyone!
 
Here's the information on this week's seminar speaker: 
 
Title:  The COMET Universe: Establishing an AI Ecosystem for Translation Quality Evaluation
 
Presenter:  Alon Lavie: VP of Language Technologies, Unbabel 
and Consulting Professor, Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.
 
Abstract:
The AI neural revolution of recent years has resulted in dramatic improvements in the performance and accuracy of Machine Translation (MT) systems.  Commercial MT services translate billions of words every day, and the vast majority of translated content for both enterprises and governments are now generated using MT, edited by humans.  This progress has largely been enabled and driven by a new generation of vastly-improved translation quality evaluation technologies. In this talk, I will describe and review these underlying technologies, within the context of a long-term R&D initiative at Unbabel for establishing and developing an ecosystem for Translation Quality Evaluation.  I will highlight some of the exciting new capabilities and opportunities enabled by our emerging ability to identify translation errors and accurately measure translation quality.
 
Speaker Bio:
Alon Lavie is the VP of Language Technologies at Unbabel, a US/Portugal-based translation technology and services company, where he leads and manages Unbabel's US AI lab in Pittsburgh, and provides strategic leadership for Unbabel's AI R&D teams company-wide.  Concurrently, he is a Consulting (adjunct) Professor at the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where he has been a member of the faculty since 1996.  His primary research interests and activities focus on Machine Translation (MT) and on MT Evaluation. He directed and led the ten year development (2004-2014) of the METEOR automated MT evaluation metric. More recently, while at Unbabel, he directed the development of a new neural framework for MT evaluation named COMET, and a complementary tool for MT quality analysis named MT-Telescope. His other main research interests focus on MT adaptation approaches with and without human feedback, applied to both high-resource language pairs as well as low-resource and minority languages. Additional interests include translation Quality Estimation, and methods for multi-engine MT system combination.  He served as the President of the International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT) (2013-2015). Prior to that, he was president of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) (2008-2012), where he continues to serve as a consultant to the Executive Board. He is also a member of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), where he was president of SIGParse - ACL's special interest group on parsing (2008-2013). In August 2021, at the 18th biennial Machine Translation Summit conference, he was awarded the 2021 Makoto Nagao IAMT Award of Honour for his contributions to the field of Machine Translation.

Hi everyone,
I hope you had a wonderful weekend and that you enjoy a nice beginning of the new week. This is just a reminder that Tues will be our last class until after Thanksgiving break. We will meet tomorrow as usual and then you can see on the syllabus (attached below) and the assignments tab that we resume class on Tues Nov. 29. The assignment you see on the syllabus for TH 17th I have deleted. Nothing will be due and just take the time to get caught up in your other classes. Enjoy your break from the class and come back after Thanksgiving excited for the last two weeks (we will only have four more classes after Thanksgiving). Attendance in class has been dropping and I encourage you all to finish strongly over the next few weeks. 
See you tomorrow.

Subject: Save-the-Date: Monday, Nov. 28 3:30pm ET- What makes a compelling PhD application? Hear from EECS-at-MIT faculty who review applications!
Date: November 13, 2022 at 7:22:51 PM MST
To: bryant0918@gmail.com

Dear Bryant Mcarthur:


Hello! 

Thank you for considering EECS at MIT for your career plans to pursue a PhD degree. We are honored that you believe our PhD program will meet your professional goals. 

Please add to your calendar a zoom webinar conversation scheduled for Monday, Nov. 28th at 3:30pm ET. The agenda for the webinar is to hear from EECS department head Professor Asu Ozdaglar regarding an overview of EECS at MIT, and then to have a conversation with a number of EECS faculty and staff who have participated in our graduate admissions committee. The panelists will share their views about the application materials, the review process, and provide guidance as you work to prepare your graduate application. We apologize for the inconvenience if you reside in a very different time zone; therefore, we will record the entire discussion. We will then place the recording on our departmental YouTube channel for further viewing until December 16th, the close of the application cycle for 2023.

As the day and time nears, we will send further details regarding the zoom webinar link. Following the discussion, we will also send details regarding access to the YouTube channel. Attached here I provide two documents: (1) the questions that will be posed by me as moderator in the panel discussion, and (2) very short bios for our faculty and staff participants along with a link to their professional websites. We will also invite your questions prior to the zoom webinar as we wish to address those questions that you view as important. More details will be forthcoming as the day nears.

I look forward to our discussion, and I hope your schedule allows you to join. Thank you again for considering our PhD program for your professional and academic goals. 
I hope you are all doing well and that your fall semester/quarter/term/season is productive, successful and fun!
With best wishes to you, Professor Kolodziejski

Will Republicans really move on from Trump?

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”

Today's read: 8 minutes.
Every election has consequences, but the 2022 midterms could reverberate for years.
While the immediate impact of this cycle will be control of Congress, the outcome of ballot initiatives, and the sweeping changes to state legislatures across the country, there is one other, longer-term question bubbling up in political circles: What does this mean for Donald Trump's political future?
Heading into Tuesday, Trump was the face of the party and its unquestioned leader. The former president is a fundraising goliath and a kingmaker in primaries. Despite currently being out of office and being banned from Twitter and Facebook, he still has the loudest megaphone of any Republican on the planet. But on Tuesday night, he took a bunch of major losses.
Trump, for his part, boasted of a "great night" of 174 wins and nine losses. But those numbers, along with not including several races, are heavily skewed by Trump endorsing candidates who were sure things. When you look at the competitive races, many Republicans were far less impressed, and with good reason. Perhaps most importantly, Trump-endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz lost in Pennsylvania to Democrat John Fetterman, while Trump-endorsed Blake Masters lost in Arizona to Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly. 
Both of those candidates won their primaries after Trump pushed out Republicans that the establishment thought had better odds of winning in a general election. As Trump-endorsed candidates began to fall in competitive races across the country, and even some Trumpian favorites like Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) faced unexpected challenges, the commentary on the right around his role took a noticeably negative turn. Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal called Trump "The Republican Party's Biggest Loser," arguing that he "has now flopped in 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022."
"Looking at the Senate map, the message could not be clearer," the board said. "In New Hampshire, the Trump-endorsed Republican Don Bolduc lost to Sen. Maggie Hassan, 53% to 45%, as of the latest data. At the same time voters re-elected Republican Gov. Chris Sununu by 16 points... In Georgia, the Trump-endorsed Republican Herschel Walker trails Sen. Raphael Warnock, 49.4% to 48.5%... Mr. Walker’s flaws as a candidate were obvious, but Mr. Trump helped clear the primary field and other candidates opted out... Tim Michels in Wisconsin and Tudor Dixon in Michigan fumbled winnable gubernatorial races. Also in Michigan, Mr. Trump helped John Gibbs beat GOP Rep. Peter Meijer in the primary in the Grand Rapids seat because Mr. Meijer voted to impeach him. Mr. Gibbs lost by 13 points. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler also voted to impeach Mr. Trump, who helped Joe Kent beat her in a primary. Mr. Kent is trailing in that Washington state district."
Even in races where Trump's candidates won, they didn't outperform the non-Trump candidates. JD Vance won his Senate seat in Ohio by six points, a comfortable margin. But Republican Gov. Mike DeWine won by 26 points. Similarly, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) won re-election by eight points, while Trump-endorsed Herschel Walker is trailing in the Senate race and will have to go to a runoff to have a shot at winning.
On Fox News, the typically unabashed pro-Trump line-up seemed to wonder aloud what was going on. Jesse Watters asked what Trump was doing with the "war chest" of party funds he had raised. Laura Ingraham, one of the channel’s most popular primetime hosts and longtime Trump backer, made some not-so-subtle comments: “The populist movement is about ideas,” she said. “It is not about any one person. If the voters conclude that you’re putting your own ego or your own grudges ahead of what’s good for the country, they’re going to look elsewhere, period.”
The New York Post depicted him as Humpty Dumpty. Kaleigh McEnany, Trump's former spokesperson, urged him to think about uniting the party rather than bickering with Republican rivals. His former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he could lose a 2024 primary.
Ryan Girdusky, who pens the National Populist Newsletter and has been one of the most pro-Trump commentators I've followed since 2016, wrote this on Thursday:
Trump raised millions over $100 million that he either spent hoarding for his upcoming presidential run or paying his army of consultants and influencers that do nothing besides offer bad advice and poor excuses. While he cracked open his wallet at the end, it was too little and too late... While Trump is going out of this election with more wins than losses, the individual losses are big enough to outweigh all the wins. It’s like being an amazing baseball player who is the home run champ at every game until he goes to the playoffs. Fighting over a participation trophy is a rather stupid way to spend your time…  Last note on Trump, as someone who supported him from the day he first came down the escalator in 2016, his message and tone have changed in a way I don’t think he’s going to be able to come back from. He spoke about winning so much you’d get tired of winning, securing the border, and calling out obvious truths that were plaguing America including a corrupt and ineffective leadership class. What does Trump talk about today? He was screwed out of the presidency, he was a victim of people in the White House that he hired, and he doesn’t like Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney — two men he endorsed.   To paraphrase a line from one of my favorite books Cold Mountain, they call this election a cloud over the land. But Trump made the weather and then he stands in the rain and says 'Shit, it's raining!' I know hundreds of Republicans and I can count on both hands how many of them want to see Trump be the party’s nominee in 2024.
There was plenty more. Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears, the right-hand of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said, "A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage, and the voters have given us that very clear message... I could not support him.”
Mike Lawler, the newly minted New York representative who just flipped a Democratic seat red, used his first national television appearance after winning to insist the party needs to dump Trump.
The day after the election, Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice president, published an excerpt from his forthcoming memoir that paints Trump in one of the worst lights possible. He quotes Trump’s efforts to pressure him into throwing the democratic process into chaos, then portrays him as sad and regretful when he realized he’d lost, even when he wouldn’t say so publicly.
In a matter of hours, the knives were out for the former president.
Obviously, the big follow-up question is, "if not Trump, then who?"
The only way he doesn't survive as de facto leader of the party is if someone replaces him. Mitch McConnell is the leader of Republicans in Congress, and we're about to witness an epic fight over who gets the gavel in the House. Other 2024 presidential names have been floating for months: Nikki Haley, Ted Cruz, Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, and even Tim Scott. But if Trump isn't going to be the face of the party, the biggest winner from Tuesday who may fill his shoes is undoubtedly Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
He won the state by 19 points and flipped Miami-Dade County, a former Democratic stronghold, red. He's got powerful support among suburban women and Hispanic voters, and he's managed to pair the nationalist, culture war style that makes Trump appealing to so many voters with tangible legislative victories for conservatives in his state.
"Ron DeSantis is the new Republican party leader," Liz Peek said in Fox News. "In Miami-Dade County, a region which President Joe Biden won by 16 percentage points in 2020, the popular governor won easily. Not only was the margin of victory astounding in itself, it also reinforced an emerging reality: Hispanic voters may be shifting their long-term alliance to Republicans. DeSantis won because he embraced Trumpian policies, stood firm against the woke mob, led his state through the pandemic with brilliance and, more recently, managed the horrific damage done by Hurricane Ian with great competence. Florida residents rewarded the popular governor by re-electing him with roughly a 19-point margin over his opponent, Democrat Charlie Crist."
Trump’s biggest problem, right now, are the tangible results. Which are also tied to his messaging. Republicans were routed in 2018, Trump himself lost in 2020, Democrats had a few big special election victories in 2021 (and a couple notable losses), and now they’re pulling off a shockingly good performance in 2022.
As a result, as Girdusky noted, Trump simply isn’t spending a lot of time talking about the things that animated the entire Republican base six years ago: Immigration, the corrupt establishment, and the hollowed out middle class. Instead, he rants about stolen elections and all the horrible ways he was treated — even bashing the very people he once endorsed (or hired), which doesn’t reflect well on his judgment.
That messaging matters because, at the core of it, Trump’s success is built in part on his personality. For the voters who have felt unheard, disrespected and screwed over for so many decades, “owning the libs” and being more powerful than establishment Republicans is key to Trump’s appeal. But what happens when the libs are owning him? What happens when Republican establishment candidates outperform the ones he hand picks? The right may turn to someone else, like DeSantis, who is actually winning.
On the other hand, while there is no doubt DeSantis's position for 2024 just improved significantly, I'd also offer a few words of caution.

Hello, 

I'm reaching out to you because you have loaned Manifest Development money in the past. If you're looking for a place to put cash to work, then we currently have an opportunity. 

We are working on putting together our first apartment building project. See the attached deck. It is a 5-over-1 podium build with ~143 units in Salt Lake City. 

We currently need $100,000 to help us with the pre-construction expenses (primarily architectural fees, surveying and geotechnical work, etc.). We're willing to sign promissory notes that pay 12% and pay the debt back, plus all accrued interest, in the spring or early summer of next year when one of two things happen: 

1. We raise equity from a capital partner. The attached deck is from our hired brokers who are actively searching for the $11m required for the project. After one week they are reporting strong interest.  
2. We sell the project. We have a good land basis and may sell the land to another developer at a profit. We plan to have the listing go live today. 

We're willing to piece the $100,000 from a few different parties, but would probably prefer to have minimums of $10,000. Let me know if you're interested in learning more, and feel free to share with anyone that may be interested.

Everything we missed (and an update).
BY ISAAC SAUL – 10 NOV 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
 
I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 10 minutes.
🇺🇸
We're covering everything that didn't make it into the newsletter yesterday, a reader question, and my thoughts on some of the election fraud claims from the last few days.

Mystery day.
Tomorrow is Friday. That means we are releasing a subscribers-only edition of Tangle. Given the madness of this week, I'm not even sure what we'll be covering — it depends how the day breaks today, and which of the few newsletters that we have in the bank we decide to expand on. This is a reminder that if you want to receive Friday editions, you need to become a Tangle member.

Quick hits.
	1.	Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) officially announced his plans to run for Speaker of the House if Republicans win the majority. (The announcement)
	2.	Russia announced plans to withdraw from the key Ukrainian city of Kherson. (The withdrawal)
	3.	Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) penned a handwritten apology to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for comments last month in which he made light of the attack on her husband. (The apology) 
	4.	President Biden held a press conference yesterday to tout unexpected Democratic strength in the midterms and reaffirm his intentions to run for a second term in 2024. (The presser)
	5.	The Supreme Court appears closely divided in an adoption case challenging the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which makes it difficult to remove Native American children from their tribes and heritage. (The case) 
Our 'Quick Hits' section is created in partnership with Ground News, a website and app that rates the bias of news coverage and news outlets. 

Georgia update.
It's official: We're headed to a runoff. Neither Raphael Warnock (D) nor Herschel Walker (R) were able to capture 50% of the vote, which by the election rules in Georgia means the two will face off in a December 6 runoff election. 49.4% of the vote went to Warnock, 48.5% went to Walker, and the Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver received 2% of the vote.

Arizona update.
In Arizona, we may not know who wins the Senate race between Mark Kelly (D) and Blake Masters (R) or who wins the gubernatorial race between Katie Hobbs (D) and Kari Lake (R) until Thursday night. That is when reporters and election experts in the state expect to see a huge batch of mail ballots that were hand delivered to polling places on Tuesday get counted. In Maricopa County alone, there are an estimated 400,000 to 410,000 such ballots, according to local reporters. They include:
	•	17,000 ballots cast on election day but yet to be counted.
	•	239,116 early ballots left to process and tabulate
	•	143,779 early votes left to verify
	•	7,885 estimated provisional ballots left to research and certify
The early tallies of those ballots — and how they break for the candidates — will likely give us a clearer idea as to who is winning. Since yesterday's newsletter, both races have moved decidedly in the direction of Arizona's Republican candidates, though they still trail. The governor's race, in particular, looks to be tightening, while Masters is closing Kelly's lead in the Senate race but has a tougher hill to climb.

Nevada update.
The Senate race in Nevada is still too close to call, but Democrats got good news from Jon Ralston, the legendary Nevada election reporter. Heading into the race, Ralston had predicted Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto would squeak by Republican Adam Laxalt. After the first wave of results came in, he started to backtrack, joking that he wished he could delete his predictions (due to high rural turnout).
But last night, Ralston gave an update that there were about 110,000 mail-in ballots remaining, and posited that if Cortez Masto continued to win them at the clip she had been (roughly 65%), she'd win easily.
"If her margin decreases from 65-30 to 60-30, for instance, she would still win decisively," he said on Twitter. "If it is 60-35, same. If it's 55-30, same. If it's 55-35, same. She wins in all those models. Buckle up."
In other words: as it stands right now, Cortez Masto has the inside track.

The big picture.
Republicans have the inside track to a majority in the House of Representatives, but need to win two of the three races mentioned above to get a Senate majority — which looks increasingly unlikely. However, they could still take the governorship in Arizona. While the "red wave" never materialized, running the table in a few critical remaining races could salvage what looked like a very bad night just 24 hours ago. It's going to come down to the wire.

The House update. 
Again: Republicans should be able to win a House majority, but it is a lot closer than anyone expected. Here is how David Wasserman described the state of play:
The NBC News House estimate is that Republicans will win 220 seats plus or minus 10 seats, meaning the fate of the House rests with nine uncalled competitive races in California, six in New York, two in Nevada, two in Oregon, two in Arizona, two in Colorado and a smattering in other states. Republicans have a slightly better than even chance of taking the House, but this could take more than a week to sort out (especially in slow-counting California and Arizona), and could depend on recounts. If it weren't for GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin's coattails in the New York governor's race, Democrats might be favorites to hold onto their majority.

New results.
Since yesterday's newsletter, we've gotten a few more important results.
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) officially won reelection over Mandela Barnes (D) while Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — officially lost in a stunning defeat to Republican Mike Lawler.
In Oregon, Democrat Tina Kotek was declared the winner over Christine Drazan (R) in a tight gubernatorial race that Republicans hoped would turn into an upset. In New Mexico, Democrat Gabriel Vasquez defeated Rep. Yvette Herrell. Republican Ryan Zinke won election to the U.S. House in Montana's 1st Congressional District.
In Arizona, Eli Crane (R) defeated Tom O'Halleran (D), flipping the seat red. In Kansas, Gov Laura Kelly (D) won reelection.
In New York, Republicans Marc Molinaro and Anthony D'Esposito both pulled out House victories, while Democrats Matt Cartwright and Chris Deluzio both won their races in Pennsylvania.
Derrick Van Orden (R) also flipped Rep. Ron Kind's (D) seat in Wisconsin.
The GOP now holds 207 seats in the House to Democrats 187. So far, not a single one of Cook Political's lean/likely/solid seats has broken the opposite way (this is why we use them). Of their 36 toss-up races, Democrats have won 18, Republicans have won 7, and 11 are still too close to call.

Everything we missed.
There were so many races on Tuesday, so many ballot initiatives, and so many story lines that it was impossible to fit them all into one newsletter. So, today, I want to give a rundown of all the stuff that didn't make it into Wednesday's newsletter.
It was a big night for abortion rights. Voters in California, Michigan and Vermont all backed ballot measures that enshrined the right to abortion in state law. Meanwhile, Kentucky voters rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that stated that no constitutional right to abortion exists in the state, a surprise victory for abortion rights in a red state.
Meanwhile, in Montana, voters rejected a ballot measure to give infants "born alive" at any stage of pregnancy "legal personhood" status and impose criminal penalties on health providers who don't act to keep them alive (even if they are nonviable).
Democratic gerrymandering backfired. In New York, Democrats tried to extend their Congressional map as far as they could. But in April, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that Democratic leaders had violated the State Constitution — then appointed a special master to replace the lines for this year's midterms.
As a result, Democrats have already lost Sean Patrick Maloney's seat, two seats in Long Island, and a competitive seat in upstate New York. They could go from 19 Democrats and eight Republicans this year to 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans next year, a swing that could ultimately decide the House majority.
More favorable Democrat redistricting maps succeeded in Illinois and New Mexico, but similar attempts to spread their base across more districts in Nevada and Oregon have actually led to tight races that could backfire. Meanwhile, Republican redistricting has led to big wins and non-competitive districts in Florida and Texas.
However, Pennsylvania and North Carolina have provided a different story, as both states have approved non-partisan district maps. The North Carolina map has been challenged by Republican lawmakers to the Supreme Court, which is expected to consider the case before the 2024 election. The Pennsylvania map approved this year has been enacted with much less controversy. As a result, each state’s elections were as even as it gets. Democrats eked out a 9-8 majority in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and the North Carolina House is split 7-7.
You can read our deep dive on gerrymandering here.
Medicaid expansion continues. Voters in South Dakota passed Constitutional Amendment D, which qualifies anyone making less than 133% of the federal poverty level (about $18,000 per year) for Medicaid coverage, or roughly 45,000 people. 40 states have now expanded Medicaid, and ballot initiatives have won in all 11 states where the issue went to voters: Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and now South Dakota.
Legalizing drugs was on the ballot. Six states voted on drug policy Tuesday, and the results were split down the middle. Missouri and Maryland joined 19 other states in legalizing cannabis. In Colorado, psychedelic mushrooms were legalized. Meanwhile, legal cannabis failed in South Dakota, North Dakota and Arkansas.
Many candidates who questioned or rejected the results of the 2020 election won their races, but those in competitive races fared worse. Democrats pulled off a clean sweep of GOP candidates who denied the results of the 2020 election, and ran for positions like secretary of state or governor in the swing states of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Republican gubernatorial candidates Tudor Dixon (Michigan), Doug Mastriano (Pennsylvania), Dan Cox (Maryland), Lee Zelden (New York) and Tim Michels (Wisconsin) all lost.
In the same vein, Democrats won nearly every race in which they helped fund a Republican candidate in the primary who they didn't think could win in the general. The Washington Post counted 13 primary races where Democrats backed Republican candidates they thought were too extreme to win against moderates. Only six won their primaries, and every one of them lost in the general election.
However, plenty of candidates who questioned or outright denied the 2020 election results got into office. So far, at least 160 of those candidates have won races for the House, Senate, or key statewide offices, according to a Washington Post count. Notably, the ones who have lost have conceded their races without any issues.
Young voters actually turned out — and probably saved Democrats’ night. The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts (CIRCLE) found that 63% of voters aged 18-29 supported Democrats in the midterm elections. Exit polls from CNN reported the same figure.
 
And in key swing states like Arizona, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, young voters supported Democrats at rates above 70%.
Not only that, but young voters actually showed up. The 2022 midterms marked the second highest young voter turnout in the U.S. in the last three decades, with 27% of young voters showing up in 2022, and 31% in battleground states. And yet... turnout this year was actually down compared to the historic high of 2018. We're up to 93 million House votes tallied and will surpass 100 million, according to Wasserman, but will still fall well short of the 114 million cast in 2018.
The polls were actually pretty good. As I wrote yesterday, polling averages in this year's midterms misled a lot of people — particularly the narrative of an incoming red wave. But Nate Silver rightly pointed out that his polls-only model at FiveThirtyEight isn’t looking too bad: Their forecast projected 50 Democratic Senate seats and 229 GOP House seats. "We'll probably end up at 50 +/- 1 Dem Senate seats and 222 +/- 5 GOP House seats. Pretty good!" he wrote.
Two themes appear to have driven the “red wave” narrative: 1) Many reporters and pundits jumping on polling averages, which included more partisan polls, that showed Republican strength across the board and 2) A general belief that historical precedent, which says the party in the White House typically gets crushed in the midterms, would prevail.
Even outfits like RealClearPolitics, which took some criticism for including too many outlier polls in their averages, did pretty well. According to The Wall Street Journal, Democrats performed about three points better than RCP’s averages in the eight most competitive races for the Senate — right around most polling’s margin of error.
Shockingly, slavery was also on the ballot. Vermont voters passed a constitutional amendment explicitly prohibiting slavery; Tennessee voters banned all forms of slavery in the state; Oregon voters removed langauge in the state’s constitution allowing for slavery and involuntary servitude when used as punishment for a crime. In Louisiana, voters rejected a muddled amendment that was intended to clarify a ban on slavery in the state. If you’re curious why these states needed to clarify that slavery is illegal, the AP has more context (hint: it’s about prison labor policies).
Some other odds and ends: Despite Georgia's Senate race going to a runoff, Republicans cruised everywhere else in the state. They won elections for attorney general, labor commissioner, school superintendent, secretary of state, agriculture commissioner and insurance commissioner. Herschel Walker is the only Republican candidate statewide not to win (yet).
Meanwhile, Republican Liz Cheney endorsed two Democrats — Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger — both of whom won. Democrats gained complete control of the governor’s mansion and the state House and Senate in four states, covering 30 million people: Michigan, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Maryland. Republicans swept statewide races in Iowa for the first time, and could win all four of the state's House seats. Republicans also won majorities on the Supreme Courts in Ohio and North Carolina, giving them a leg up in future redistricting fights.
Elsewhere, a Pennsylvania candidate won despite being dead. Illinois passed an amendment granting citizens the right to collective bargaining and banned "right-to-work" laws, which allow workers to be exempted from union dues. In Arizona, voters passed a proposition to limit medical debt interest rates at 3%.
Nevadans look primed to pass an amendment to implement ranked-choice-voting and open primaries, New Mexicans passed an amendment to fund pre-K education and Nebraskans voted to lift the minimum wage from $9 to $15 by January of 2027. Meanwhile in D.C., Washingtonians voted to phase out tipped minimum wage — meaning by 2026, workers who receive tips will also need to be paid the minimum wage. Voters in Oregon passed one of the strictest gun control measures in the country, while voters in California rejected a measure to introduce online and in-person sports gambling.
There were a number of races tied to crime as well, and in several of them progressives prevailed. Perhaps most notably, voters in Minneapolis elected Mary Moriarty, a former public defender, to serve as their new prosecutor. She beat out a tough-on-crime opponent by over 10 points. Massachusetts voters also got rid of Thomas Hodsgon, a Bristol County Sheriff known as the "Arpaio of the East” who became notorious for dangerous jail conditions.
Some notables we missed: Peter Welch became the first state Senator born after World War II to be elected in Vermont. Becca Balint became the first woman elected to Congress in Vermont (the last state in the country to send a woman to Congress). Robert Garcia of California is the first LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress. And James Roesener became the first out trans man elected to any state legislature (in New Hampshire).

Election fraud.
Given my experience reporting on allegations of election fraud, I’ve been tracking them during the last few days — and lots of readers have written in asking me what I've come across, and what I've been seeing. I figured I'd use some space to address that here.
First, there just haven't been that many allegations of fraud, which is great news. I put a few together here, but they all fizzled out really quickly. The only one that actually got legs was in Maricopa County, where votes are still being counted. From what we know, 20%-30% of the tabulation machines in the county were having some kind of technical issues, so voters got stuck in long lines. This led to election workers informing voters in line that the machine tabulators were down, and they had a few options: Wait, put their ballot in a separate box to be tabulated later, or go to a different polling place.
In a matter of minutes, some right-wing commentators like Charlie Kirk were alleging crimes and suggesting people should go to jail. Trump said "a lot of bad things" were happening and that Arizona was trying to delay people out of line. Kari Lake, who is running for governor, falsely claimed that machines were only malfunctioning in Republican areas. Others alleged that Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state who is running against Lake for governor, was at fault for the malfunctioning machines.
None of this was true. Hobbs is secretary of state, yes, but Arizona has a uniquely decentralized elections system, and her only job is to certify the statewide vote. Counties run their own elections. While innuendo about purported fraud was spreading, technicians in Maricopa County — which, not that it should matter, has a Republican recorder and several Republicans on its election board — were running around the county fixing the settings on machines that were having issues.
Ultimately, a court rejected Republicans' attempt to keep the polling places open for three extra hours because they "failed to include evidence in the supporting affidavits that any voter in Maricopa County was denied the right to vote as a result of tabulation errors in Maricopa County machines."
Frankly, some of the claims were just lazy. By last night, former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis was simply declaring that "Maricopa County attempted another cheat" even though they never proved a first cheat and there was no evidence of any cheating last night.
In short: Yes, there have been some claims, but none that got much attention and certainly none that required much investigation. Ironically, as the late votes come in and she closes in on her opponent, Kari Lake — who has suggested past elections were marred by obvious fraud whenever late tallies were being counted — seems perfectly happy to accept her post-election-day tallies this time around. She may very well win on the votes that came in yesterday and get counted today and tomorrow, which is unsurprising (Maricopa has a lot of Republicans voting). And while I share some voters’ frustrations about long lines and delayed election results, it’s not a sign of fraud. If Lake wins, she’ll have an opportunity as governor to reform the system.
Finally, it's also worth stating that, along with the lack of fraud evidence, this year's surprisingly close race is more proof that 2020 wasn't stolen, but simply a reflection of the national mood in the country, one that — based on all the election results and polling we have — appears to slightly favor center-left politics over the fringes on either side.

Your questions, answered.
Q: Why did Democratic Party candidates almost universally have so much more funding than Republican ones this cycle, at least in the big Senate and Governor races?  Whatever the results today end up being it's easy for me to imagine lots of narrow Democratic party wins being different if candidates like Blake Masters or Tudor Dixon (expected to lose) or J.D. Vance (expected to win) had funding even remotely close to their rivals.
— Richard from Affton, Missouri
Tangle: Well, I'll start by questioning the premise here. According to OpenSecrets, Republicans actually outspent Democrats by over 25% when it comes to federal candidates and political committees. Republicans spent about $4.6 billion to Democrats' $3.6 billion. Republicans similarly out-fundraised Democrats in governor’s races ($1.1 billion to $823 million). So, to start with, I think it is actually the opposite: Republicans outspent Democrats in this cycle, which is kind of shocking when we look at the results.
However, in the battleground states it is a lot more mixed. OpenSecrets tracks outside money spent for and against each party. In Pennsylvania, an estimated $82.9 million dollars of outside money was spent against Democrats, while $30.4 million was spent for Democrats. That compares to $12.3 million spent for Republicans and $66.6 million spent against Republicans. So by those totals, more money was spent for Democrats than for Republicans, but more money was spent against Democrats than against Republicans. Ultimately, the total figures don’t include how much of his own money Oz spent on his campaign (see today's numbers section).
In Arizona, though, $17.9 million was spent for Democrats while just $5.6 million was spent for Republicans; meanwhile, $47 million was spent against Republicans while $50.3 million was spent against Democrats. Again, it's a mixed bag.
One thing I will say, though, is that Republicans fought a lot over who to invest in. Donald Trump was sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars, and some people (including Fox News's Jesse Watters) have wondered what he is doing with all that money. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is already facing criticism for not spending more on Republicans who are narrowly losing, and there will be a lot of post-mortems there.
But no matter how you cut it, both sides really spent an absurd amount of money on this cycle. And when it comes to who spent more, Republicans appear to have actually outpaced Democrats in the totals we have.

Numbers.
	•	$373.6 million. The amount of money candidates and outside groups spent on the Pennsylvania Senate race.
	•	$27 million. The amount of his own money Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz spent on his campaign.
	•	$72 million. The amount of funding Democrat Val Demings received to run against Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida.
	•	16.4%. The margin of victory Rubio had over Demings.
	•	$7 million. The amount of money Democrats have already poured into the Georgia Senate runoff.
	•	10%. The percentage of all U.S. senators who will be named John/Jon when John Fetterman is inaugurated in January.

Have a nice day.
A truck driver from Greenville, Texas, is being hailed as a "Highway Angel" after he stopped in his travels to administer aid to two drivers who were involved in a car accident. Tony Doughty was driving eastbound on Interstate 40 near Albuquerque when he witnessed a high-speed accident. Doughty watched a jeep flip over before crashing, as he headed in the opposite direction. Instead of going on his way, he called 911, pulled his truck over, and ran across traffic with his EMT bag to help. Good News Network has the story.

Correction.
This is a very silly one, but yesterday, in our numbers sections, we described the "Arizona" Senate race between Adam Laxalt and Catherine Cortez Masto. As many eagle-eyed readers pointed out, that is the Senate race in Nevada, not Arizona. You'll have to excuse the error on account of trying to track dozens of Senate races and hundreds of House races all at once — I think my brain will need a nice break this weekend.
This is our 71st correction in Tangle's 170-week history and our first correction since October 31st. I track corrections and place them at the top of the newsletter in an effort to maximize transparency with readers.

The big picture.
"Well, that was the craziest Election Night I’ve ever seen."
Those were the first public words from Dave Wasserman, Cook Political Report's congressional election expert, on Wednesday morning. And they accurately sum up the prevailing sentiment across the political world.
The word is overused in headlines and television scripts, but in this case it actually fits: Last night was shocking.
As we noted yesterday, the party in the White House historically loses 28 House seats and four Senate seats, on average. Given President Biden's low approval ratings, the polling advantages for Republicans on the generic ballot, and the concerns over inflation and crime, many pundits and pollsters were expecting a red wave.
Instead, Democrats have a clear path to picking up a seat in the Senate and are keeping the race for the House — which seemed like a foregone conclusion — much tighter than anticipated. Republicans may still end up with control of both the Senate and House, but they will need to win two of the three still undecided Senate races in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia to get there.
Right now, they are on track to have one of the weakest performances for an out-of-power party against a first-term president that we've seen since the unique post-9/11 midterms of 2002.

What happened.
In the Senate, Democrats are holding 48 seats to Republicans' 47. In The House, Republicans have won 197 seats to Democrats' 172. Gubernatorial races in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Mexico went to Democrats, while Republicans won governorships in Georgia and Florida. We are still awaiting results from Arizona, where Katie Hobbs (D) currently has 50.33% of the vote to Kari Lake's (R) 49.67%, with 66% of the vote reported.
Senate races in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Alaska are yet to be called, and will determine which party controls the Senate for the next two years (Alaska's race is down to Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka, two Republicans, so its outcome won't impact the Senate majority; Murkowski is currently a heavy favorite to win). 66 House races across the country are still yet to be called, as of this writing.
Perhaps the biggest win of the night for Democrats was in Pennsylvania, where John Fetterman (50%) defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz (47%), and Josh Shapiro (D) cruised past Doug Mastriano by a 13-point margin in the state's gubernatorial race. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania State House is a toss-up, and if Democrats flip control of the chamber it would give them their first majority in 12 years. We gave Pennsylvania's Senate race a lot of coverage because of its implications for 2024 and what it would tell us about the national mood — and Democrats out-performed the polls. Exit polling showed abortion was the top issue for voters.
Now, all eyes turn to Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. The race between Raphael Warnock (D) and Herschel Walker (R) looks destined for a runoff, as neither candidate has 50% of the vote with 96% in. That means another election on December 6, potentially with control of the Senate at stake. In Nevada, Adam Laxalt (R) is up three points on Catherine Cortez Masto (D), but only 75% of the vote is reported — and the race is still considered a toss-up. In Arizona, Mark Kelly (D) is leading Blake Masters (R) by 6 points with 67% of the vote in, and Kelly is the clear favorite to close it out.
If Democrats manage to secure Arizona, that would mean they have to win just one of Nevada and Georgia to keep their Senate majority. In one likely scenario, Democrats could win Nevada and head into a December 6 runoff in Georgia between Warnock and Walker with an opportunity to gain a Senate seat and take a 51-49 majority.
The picture in the House is simultaneously both clearer and a lot messier. The New York Times needle, which operates on an algorithm taking in data from across the country, gives Republicans an 83% chance of controlling the House. The question now is just how big their majority will be. The Times needle currently estimates a 224-211 Republican majority, but the race could come down to several House seats in California and New York that may take days or even weeks to resolve.

Good news for Democrats. 
If you're a Democrat, given expectations, last night was something close to a best-case scenario. Pennsylvania went blue, the House is still up for grabs, and Democrats have a very reasonable path to keeping a Senate majority and even picking up a seat.
Some of the most "Trumpy" candidates performed badly. Dr. Oz, endorsed by Trump, lost decisively in Pennsylvania. Don Bolduc, endorsed by Trump, lost handily in New Hampshire (after much hype about a potential upset). Blake Masters, endorsed by Trump, is underperforming in Arizona. In Michigan, Tudor Dixon, endorsed by Trump, lost to Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race. Kari Lake is losing in Arizona, though she may pull ahead late. Even Lauren Boebert, the House Representative from Colorado who was supposed to cruise to victory, is now in a dogfight to hold her seat.
Meanwhile, Democrats look like they are going to fare much better in the House than most pollsters predicted they would. Most of that is due to the strength of turnout in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and throughout the Rust Belt. In Michigan, Democrats not only defended the governorship, but flipped the state House and Senate (winning control of the state government for the first time in 40 years), defended their Supreme Court majority, won most of their House seats, and passed a measure to preserve abortion rights.
Perhaps most notably, though, is that none of the major upsets Republicans had hoped for — in governor's races in New York, Oregon and Wisconsin, or in Senate races in New Hampshire, Colorado, Arizona and Washington — have come to fruition. Right now, Oregon’s governor’s race is their best shot at an upset, but Democrat Tina Kotek is still holding onto a 1% lead over Christine Drazan with 67% of the vote reported.

Good news for Republicans. 
For starters, they are still heavy favorites to take the U.S. House. That would give them an opportunity to be a bulwark against the Biden administration’s agenda, and they could stymie most of his legislative initiatives in the final two years of his presidency.
Republicans also had a great night in Florida, which is now unquestionably red. Ron DeSantis romped, beating Democrat and former Republican governor Charlie Crist by 19 points, winning Hispanic voters (57%), women (52%), suburban voters (58%) and independents (52%). He became the first Republican governor to win Miami-Dade county since Jeb Bush was re-elected in 2002. Talk of a 2024 presidential run will only grow louder after his performance last night.
Republicans also put away the races they were supposed to. J.D. Vance easily won his Senate race in Ohio, defeating former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan (D). Ted Budd won the North Carolina seat that was vacated by the departing Richard Burr (R), holding off a strong challenge from Cheri Beasley. And Ron Johnson looks poised to win his tight Senate race in Wisconsin.
It's also worth noting that Republicans did threaten in some places they rarely do. Perhaps most notably was in New York, where Lee Zeldin (R) won 47% of the vote in the governor's race, the best showing for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in 20 years. On top of that, Republicans look poised to unseat House Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. They are also still within striking distance in Oregon’s gubernatorial race.

What the right is saying. 
	•	Many on the right are criticizing Trump's endorsements and furious about a missed opportunity to get a stranglehold on Congress.
	•	Some celebrate Ron DeSantis and the dominance of Republicans in Florida.
	•	Others question whether Republicans will actually make use of their incoming power.
In a piece that captures the mood on the right, Isaac Schorr wrote in National Review that Republicans were "choosing to lose."
"No one forced New Hampshire Republicans to choose Don Bolduc, the spineless conspiracy theorist, as their nominee to serve in the United States Senate. But they did, and now the race has been called for incumbent Democrat Maggie Hassan with less than 40 percent of the expected vote reporting," he said. "No one forced Pennsylvania Republicans to choose Doug Mastriano, a dyed-in-the-wool stop-the-stealer who attended the rally that led to the riot at the Capitol Building in January 2021, to be their gubernatorial nominee. But they did, and now not only has his race been called, but his candidacy might be the difference between Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz making Mitch McConnell majority leader again and letting Chuck Schumer hold onto the title.
"There are a number of other statewide candidates who may or may not lose winnable races — Blake Masters in Arizona and Herschel Walker in Georgia come to mind — and it appears that, while the GOP will retake the House of Representatives, it will not be by the margin it had hoped to," Schorr said. "Sometimes, events out of a party’s control condemn them to electoral losses. But oftentimes, losing is a choice, and the fact remains that in several states, Republican voters simply chose to lose."
The Wall Street Journal editorial board celebrated DeSantis's huge victory.
“Ron DeSantis was expected to win re-election as Florida Governor, but the big news Tuesday was the magnitude of his victory. His nearly 20-point rout of Democrat Charlie Crist shows the magnitude of the political change in the once-swing state and may launch the Republican’s campaign for the White House. The Governor won nearly everywhere in the state, and notably in Democratic strongholds. He won by double digits in heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade County, which Joe Biden carried by 85,000 votes and a statewide Republican hadn’t carried since Jeb Bush won re-election 2002. Mr. DeSantis also won Osceola County south of Orlando, which has a heavy Puerto Rican population. He even won in Democratic Palm Beach County.
"The DeSantis tide lifted other GOP candidates, as Sen. Marco Rubio won reelection handily," the board said. "The GOP also picked up two House seats, including the St. Petersburg seat Mr. Crist gave up to run for Governor. Florida has been trending to the GOP for some time, and previous two-term Governors Mr. Bush and Rick Scott did much to demonstrate effective Republican governance. But Mr. DeSantis won by fewer than 34,000 votes in 2018. He was leading Tuesday by nearly 1.5 million with 90% of the vote counted. Florida Democrats are going to have to rethink their campaigns in the state."
In The Federalist, Christopher Bedford asked if Republicans would make use of their power in the House.
"Will they halt the president’s extremely successful judicial nomination record? Halt it completely, without exception?" Bedford asked. "Will they ask where the billions in dollars and arms going to Ukraine ended up, or just keep sleepwalking toward a nuclear standoff? Will they claw back the IRS’s newfound funds, or leave their tens of thousands of new agents on the job? Will they continue to send $45 billion to America’s hard-left universities without a word of objection, as they have for years? Will they demand funding for a wall, end funding toward abortions here and abroad, and refuse to confirm ambassadors and other posts devoted to spreading the left’s culture war to Vatican City and further abroad?
"Will they break up the Big Tech companies who wield their power to control the flow of information to voters? Or on all these issues, will they just tinker around the edges and go on Fox News to crow about it?" he asked. "Conservatives have been losing for about a century now, and at this point rightly find little to conserve. If this will change any at all, they’ll need to think of themselves not as conservatives, but as revolutionaries. If they’re going to make a difference, they might as well: They’ll be up against a powerful executive, its sprawling army of lifelong employees, its allies in the intelligence agencies, Pentagon, corporate media, Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and beyond."

What the left is saying.
	•	The left is celebrating the results, arguing that the red wave never materialized and emphasizing Democrats’ good chances to hold the Senate.
	•	Some wonder if Republicans will deny how poorly they performed or finally acknowledge the strength of Democrats.
	•	Others are hammering the "liberal media" for concocting a red wave that didn't exist.
In The Washington Post, Karen Tumulty said the expected red wave "looks like a puddle."
"Political forecasters had it wrong. Again," she said. "Although votes are still being counted in many of the most closely watched races, with control of the House and Senate unclear, it is already apparent that the expected Great Red Wave of 2022 turned out to be a messy puddle. Yes, the most powerful winds all seemed to be blowing the GOP’s way: The curse of history that says a first-term president gets a comeuppance in the midterms, President Biden’s listless approval rating, roaring inflation, an economy that appears to be on the edge of recession, an alarming crime rate, record numbers of migrants coming over the border.
"But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) had it right back in August, when he said that, especially in Senate races, 'candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.' By Wednesday morning, only one Senate seat had flipped, and that was in the direction of the Democrats, with Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, despite suffering a serious stroke, beating celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz," she wrote. "Voters, it would appear, saw this midterm as something more than a referendum on the party in power; with Republicans putting forward a host of extreme, election-denying candidates and little by way of an agenda, it became a choice between two drastically different paths forward. And while abortion was not the silver bullet that some Democrats had thought it might be, it helped."
In Slate, Jim Newell asked if Republicans will pretend like they won or acknowledge reality?
"As more states rolled in, it was clear Republicans would not have the night of their dreams," Newell wrote. "Democrats kept two of the three Virginia House seats they were monitoring as potential defections in a red wave. They held a crucial Rhode Island House seat that Republicans had targeted. Democrats won five out of Ohio’s fifteen districts, when they feared they might only win two under Republicans’ gerrymandered map. Democrats would go on to hold toss-ups in reddening South Texas, both of New Hampshire’s House seats, and knock off [Bo Hines] one of Donald Trump’s prized recruits in North Carolina. By the time McCarthy spoke [at 1:57 a.m. EST] to say that Republicans would win, in fact, there was still a chance that Nancy Pelosi might retain the speaker’s gavel.
"In the Senate, the outer perimeter of races Republicans thought they might have a chance at winning under wave-like conditions—Colorado, New Hampshire, and Washington—weren’t even close. Republican J.D. Vance did win in Ohio, and Republican Rep. Ted Budd defeated Cheri Beasley in North Carolina. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson was narrowly but consistently leading over Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin, a hold the Republicans ultimately will need to have any shot at taking the Senate," Newell wrote. "Democratic governors won reelection in three crucial swing states that could be determinative in a 2024 presidential race—Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania—and took back control in Maryland and Massachusetts after eight years of Republican governors."
In The New Republic, Michael Tomasky criticized the liberal media for what it got wrong about the midterms.
"Exit polls should be taken with a grain of salt these days, but they’re all we have, and they show that the media got four main narratives really, really wrong. Independents and moderates backed Democrats. It was close, maybe within the margin of error, but in the two exit polls conducted, Democrats won. The network exit poll by Edison Research gave Democrats a 49–47 advantage, while the AP’s survey had Democrats up 39–35 (with a large undecided)," Tomasky wrote. "Abortion mattered after all. It became conventional wisdom in early-to-mid October that Dobbs wasn’t an issue anymore and that Democrats had made a crushing mistake by spending all that TV ad money on abortion. No one cared.
"Well, the network poll (Edison) had inflation the number one issue at 31 percent but abortion a close second at 27 percent," he said. "Latinos did not abandon the Democratic Party. This was a whopper. In the mainstream media, Latinos had basically become Republican. They hated abortion, all manifestations of wokery, many were evangelical, and on and on and on. The network poll had Latinos going Democratic 60–39, and in the AP poll it was 56–38... Joe Biden was not a huge albatross around Democrats’ neck. He was underwater on approval in the exits, and he perhaps didn’t help in some races, but he sure didn’t drag Democrats down the way so many in the media predicted."

My take. 
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
Welp, this is why I so rarely make predictions.
For starters, a mea culpa: I tried to read the tea leaves and I missed. I was quite confident that Oz would win in Pennsylvania and I suspected historical trends would prevail — pointing to a Republican blowout. I'll take some credit for hedging a little bit yesterday when I wrote the following (emphasis mine):
This election does not seem particularly complicated to me. It's a midterm election, inflation is high, Biden's approval ratings are low, and Democrats are likely to lose a lot of House seats and probably the Senate, too. Historically, the party in the White House loses 28 House seats and four Senate seats, on average. Democrats' saving grace is that in several of the most important Senate races, there are Republican candidates that appeal strongly to base voters on the right but have very high disapproval ratings among moderates and independents. It's possible that saves them a Senate majority, but I think it is unlikely.
There are going to be weeks of navel gazing and post-mortems to try to understand what is happening right now, but here are my first impressions:
For starters, it's a terrible night for Republicans. I don't know how else to frame it honestly. Your opportunities to face a disliked president with historic inflation in a midterm season where control of the Senate is possible and a House route is likely only come around every so often — and Republicans simply missed their chance. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was confidently predicting Republicans would pick up 60 seats in the House. At this rate they'll be lucky to snag 15.
The picture in the Senate is far worse. Kelly is outrunning Masters in Arizona, and there are a lot of mail-in ballots still coming. Nevada is a jump ball, but even if Democrats lose they will probably come out of the gates as favorites in a Georgia runoff to retain control. In the Senate races, there is zero doubt you'd rather be in Democrats’ shoes than Republicans’.
Of course, the results are to say nothing of the mess this will cause in intra-party squabbles on the right. Donald Trump is already being blamed by longtime allies for pushing weak candidates, and Fox News is running headlines like "Conservatives point finger at Trump after GOP's underwhelming election loss: 'He's never been weaker.'"
Not only will there now be a battle over who is actually leading the party — DeSantis, McConnell, or Trump — but there is going to be a dogfight over the speaker's gavel if Republicans do take the majority in the House. McCarthy was banking on a blowout to secure his spot. With the majority so thin, though, he is going to face stiff challenges from the right, and the ensuing battles could divide the party even further.
Remember: 24 hours ago, we were wondering if New York might go red or whether Democrats could manage to hold onto 48 seats in the Senate. None of those things came to fruition. As of this writing, Republicans haven't pulled off a single major upset in the Senate or gubernatorial races, and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona all look like they are moving left, not right.
So how did everyone get it so wrong? One good theory was floated in the pages of Tangle a couple of weeks ago and now looks prescient: Junk polls. After 2016 and 2020, pollsters were trying desperately to fix their problem of undercounting support for Trump and politicians like him. This cycle, one way they did that was by including polling averages from places like the Trafalgar Group, who have a well known right-wing bias. Those polls were way, way off.
One example: Trafalgar’s polling on the Washington Senate race between Patty Murray (D) and Tiffany Smiley (R) had Murray leading by only 1.2%. She won by 15%.
Including polls like that in the averages made a lot of elections look much closer than they really were, and left pollsters, reporters and pundits like me blindsided by the results.
As I said yesterday, there was only one person I saw who was bucking the narrative, and that was Simon Rosenberg of the progressive group NDN. Rosenberg’s final midterm update — "I'd rather be us than them" — was uniquely bullish on Democrats, and is the closest I’ve seen to someone accurately predicting what we appear to be witnessing right now. I said I’d give him kudos if things panned out that way, so consider this my acknowledgement.
Of course, there were a lot of other things pundits (including me) got wrong. For starters, Democratic turnout was also severely undershot. That races like the Senate battle in Pennsylvania — which some election officials thought could take days to resolve — were called last night is reflective of how many voters in blue areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh swarmed to the polls. It was over shortly after midnight, and once we had the first results it was never really close. Fetterman outperformed Biden basically everywhere. Additionally, the results came in pretty fast.
I was also surprised to see that mail-in votes were actually released first in Pennsylvania, bucking expectations of a long count that would work against a “red mirage.” That was true in Wisconsin, too, which got its results out much faster than election workers said they would. And, perhaps because of this, we saw very few allegations of fraud or election malfeasance. 
The one notable example was in Maricopa County, where tabulation machines were malfunctioning early Tuesday, leaning to some on the right calling for criminal indictments and trials. But the issue was mostly a nothingburger, got resolved quickly, and the Republicans running the election there communicated clearly about what the issue was and how voters could navigate it.
There is still much to be resolved. Georgia is in runoff territory, which would mean an early December redo. Nevada has no clear winner. It looks like Democrats are in a strong position in Arizona's Senate race. And dozens of House races in states that will be counting mail-in votes for a few days are going to take some time to resolve.
But right now, one thing is clear: The punditry missed, badly. And so did Republicans.

Notables.
In every election, there are some key races and "firsts" that are worth noting. Even though many results are still incoming from 2022, last night had a number of historically significant outcomes, and a few closely watched races have been decided.
	•	In Alaska, Mary Peltola (D) is poised to defeat Sarah Palin (R) in their much-watched ranked-choice voting House race.

🇺🇸
Today is election day. We're giving our final preview and rundown of the midterms, what we're watching, and what to expect. Plus, a question about my perfect voting system. 
From today's advertiser: It can be challenging to find unbiased news sources these days. There is one outlet I trust for everything from culture and science to sports and politics: 1440. It's one of the first things I read every morning. The team of PhDs and industry experts at 1440 scour over 100 news sources to create one daily email that gets you caught up on the day’s events in just five minutes. It’s independent and 100% free; sign up for 1440 here.

The winner! 
Yesterday's contest winner is Bev from southern California. One hour and nineteen minutes after the newsletter went out, Bev correctly guessed that I was in Taos, New Mexico, where I'll be for the next couple of days before heading to Palm Desert, California to speak on a panel about democracy. The most common guesses: Arizona, Pennsylvania and Utah. Two other readers guessed New Mexico, and one guessed Alamogordo, New Mexico.
I asked Bev if they wanted to say something about Tangle in the newsletter, and here was their response:
"Over the last year or so, I have been on a quest to find balanced reporting. I am sick of all the murder, mayhem, catastrophes, and, most of all, the political bashing that goes on in the media. I believe the media isn’t really interested in informing people of issues, they are merely interested in making money. In their view, hysteria sells, whether it’s newsprint or commercials. I believe they are fear-mongering as well...
My point is this: I read Tangle because both sides are presented with facts only, no opinions (until you get to the bottom of the report), no hysteria. I appreciate Isaac Saul’s opinion at the end, but if I want to make up my own mind rather than be swayed by yet another journalist, I can skip that part of the report. Well done, Tangle. I hope there are other journalists who follow suit."
Thank you, Bev!

Today's topic.
Election day. On Tuesday, millions of voters across the country will head to the polls to elect members of the U.S. House and Senate. There are also dozens of gubernatorial races, as well as races to fill the state legislatures and decide ballot initiatives. By Monday evening, some 44,273,515 Americans had already voted.
Currently, the Senate is split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote. Democrats hold a slim 220 to 212 majority over Republicans in the House. Republicans have 28 governorships to Democrats' 22.
RealClearPolitics currently gives Republicans a 48%-45.3% edge on an average of generic Congressional ballot polls, while FiveThirtyEight gives Republicans a 46.9% to 45.7% edge.
The Senate: With the Senate split 50-50, there are 14 Democrat-controlled seats and 21 Republican-controlled seats up for election in this Senate cycle. According to Cook Political report's final ratings, there are eight solid Democrat seats, one likely Democrat seat and two lean Democrat seats. There are 14 solid Republican seats, three likely Republican seats, and three lean Republican seats, which means there are four toss-up races that are likely to decide control of the Senate: Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada.
Currently, FiveThirtyEight's simulation predicts Republicans to win a Senate majority 59 times out of 100.
The House: Currently, Democrats hold a slim 220 to 212 majority over Republicans in the House. 218 seats is the magic number for a majority. According to Cook Political's latest ratings, there are 159 solid Democrat seats, 13 likely Democrat seats, and 15 lean Democrat seats. There are 188 solid Republican seats, 11 likely Republican seats, and 13 lean Republican seats. There are 36 toss-up races. In other words, if Republicans and Democrats all win the races they are expected to win, Republicans would have to win just six of the 36 toss-up races to gain a majority, while Democrats would have to win 31 of 36 to keep theirs.
Currently, FiveThirtyEight's simulation predicts Republicans to win a House majority 84 times out of 100.
The governorships: Currently, Republicans control 28 governorships while Democrats control 22. There are 16 Democratic and 20 Republican-held governorships on the ballot with five rated as toss-up races: Kansas, Nevada, Oregon, Wisconsin and Arizona.

	•	No matter where you are, you should vote.
	•	You can find your personalized sample ballot here.
Important note: As was true in 2020, some states — including critical swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — still don't allow local officials to begin processing mail-in ballots before election day. That means we may not have full results until Wednesday or Thursday or, if the races are extremely close, even later. In Georgia, if no Senate candidate gets 50% of the vote and we have a runoff election, the outcome may not be decided until December 6th.
Tomorrow, we'll be running another newsletter on the midterms with the known results, reactions to those results, and the best updates we can provide on the races that are still undecided. We'll continue to cover the results of the election, and commentary about those results, throughout the week.
Today, we're going to take a look at some final thoughts from the right and left heading into the election. Then, my take.

What the right is saying.
	•	Many on the right expect to take control of the House and Senate, and say Democrats are paying the price for their policies.
	•	Some say Democrats are trying to distract voters from their policies by purporting that democracy is "at risk."
	•	Others say the left-wing media is finally waking up to reality.
In The Federalist, Margot Cleveland said democracy isn't at risk — Democrats are, so they want to avoid substantive issues.
"Rather than sell voters on why Democrats will be better representatives, the 'democracy at risk' pitch pretends that electing Republicans will destroy the very democratic process the voters just engaged in. It is both silly and a circularly self-negating theory," Cleveland said. "In contrast, Republican candidates running for everything from school board member, to state legislator or governor, to House representative or senator are hammering the harm that has befallen our country since Democrats took over less than two years ago. Inflation, high gas prices, still-rising interest rates, and a recession represent the pocketbook issues voters place atop their list of concerns. The open border, high crime rates, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has siphoned off billions from U.S. taxpayers, add to the anti-Democrat sentiments.
"And while Democrats thought the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe provided them a trump card for the midterm elections, the key constituent group targeted with promises to codify Roe — suburban women — showed instead more concern over the current dire economic conditions," she wrote. "Those bread-and-butter issues, coupled with anger over the shutdown of schools and the harm inflicted on their children, seem to have pushed suburban moms to the right. The sexualization of youth and the growing indoctrination of kids in trans ideology in schools, and especially the opening of girls’ locker rooms and sports teams to boys, are also prompting moderate Democrats to vote Republican — some for the first time in their lives."
In National Review, Jim Geraghty said the red tsunami is "coming into view."
"I think one of the big stories of the 2022 midterms is how much the dynamics haven’t changed. This looked like a big GOP wave year back in the spring; it looked like a more modest GOP wave year back in midsummer; and it’s steadily looked more and more like a big GOP wave year as autumn progressed," he wrote. "I also think a lot of the 'Democrats will keep the House and gain seats in the Senate' talk since summer amounted to Democratic and media wish-casting, seeing what they wanted to see instead of what was there. Throughout the summer and fall, I thought Republicans were going to win 20-25 House seats and finish with at least 51 Senate seats — a 'pretty good' wave year... Now that we’re at the election’s eve, I think we’re on the higher end of a red-wave year, and approaching ‘red tsunami’ territory.
"For the past week or so, my back-of-the-envelope math envisioned a GOP House majority somewhere between 229 and 241, and I’m sticking to that. Give the Republicans the 212 seats in Cook Political Report, with two-thirds of the 35 races in the toss-up category, and you end up with 235 Republicans and 200 Democrats, so put those down as my final prediction numbers," he wrote. "By midnight Eastern, we probably won’t have sufficient results to declare a winner in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, and Georgia is likely to go to a runoff... With Bolduc, Laxalt, and Johnson winning, I come out to a 51–48 GOP advantage by the end of the week, with Walker and Warnock headed to a runoff. It wouldn’t shock me if Oz or Masters or both won, giving Republicans a 53- or 54-seat majority."
The Wall Street Journal editorial board said the liberal media is finally waking up.
"The midterm election isn’t over until the votes of suburban women sing, but you can tell Democrats are in trouble by reading the liberal columnists in the last couple of days. The angst is palpable, and they’ve begun to blame Democrats for their strategy and communication," the board said. “The news here is that these 'pre-mortems'—and we could point to many others—are coming from progressive writers who want Democrats to win. They’re upset that the polls are predicting a rough night on Tuesday, and they’re getting their licks in early to knock their allies for losing to, egad, those evil Republicans.
"This is the same media crowd that supported Democrats when they defunded police in 2020 and pooh-poohed the summer riots that ruined entire neighborhoods," they wrote. "The same crowd that jeered at doubters who warned that the American Rescue Plan Act of March 2021 was spending way too much in an already recovering economy. And the same crowd that supported school and business pandemic shutdowns that inspired a voter backlash. We and others warned about all this, but too many Democrats and their media allies live in a progressive bubble that ignores competing ideas. If Democrats lose Tuesday, one reason will be this closed ideological feedback loop."

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left worry about losing seats in the House and Senate, and fear "election deniers" coming into power.
	•	Some urge voters to cast ballots that preserve democratic norms.
	•	Others say Democrats were always going to lose in the midterms, because that is what usually happens, and people will make the outcome fit their narratives.
The Washington Post editorial board said voters should keep it in mind that this "is not a normal election."
"In deciding whether and how to vote, Americans should keep the fundamentals in mind, supporting candidates committed to the democratic system and the peaceful transfer of power, and opposing those who have tried to profit from toxic lies about election integrity," the board said. "Otherwise, those who stoke unfounded suspicions and widen divisions might prevail. This would encourage others to mimic them. It would also hand over critical elements of the machinery of democracy to election deniers in advance of the 2024 presidential race. Such candidates have appeared all over the map. A Post count found that in 10 states, election deniers are running to become their states’ chief elections officials, such as Arizona’s Mark Finchem (R), Michigan’s Kristina Karamo (R) and Nevada’s Jim Marchant (R).
"In office, deniers could make voting more difficult, encourage doubts about the integrity of the count, run conspiracy-theory-inspired vote audits — as the Arizona Senate did following the 2020 election — or even refuse to certify election results," they wrote. "Meanwhile, if Republican Doug Mastriano were to win Pennsylvania’s governorship, he would have substantial control over voting in a key swing state. Then there are Republican Senate candidates such as New Hampshire’s Don Bolduc and Arizona’s Blake Masters. Members of the House and Senate will have to count presidential electoral votes in 2024; the more election deniers elected, the more likely a partisan congressional majority might overturn a legitimate presidential vote."
In The Washington Post, Catherine Rampell said Democrats are drowning in denial.
"Inflation offers one illustrative example," she said. "First, they declared the problem was exaggerated, if not wholly invented, by the media — both mainstream and, especially, right-wing — despite some internal Democratic polling suggesting inflation was a growing worry among voters. Democrats also told themselves that lower-income households were benefiting from progressive decisions to keep stimulating an already 'hot' economy, and were therefore insulated from inflation...Meanwhile, any non-right-wing experts who warned early on that inflation could become a serious problem were accused of being cranks, attention-seeking contrarians or, sometimes, even traitors (if they happened to be former Democratic administration officials, anyway). Tough love was perceived as disloyalty.
"It’s not just inflation. Democrats have plugged their ears to bad news on other issues, too. They’ve downplayed voters’ concerns on crime, violent protests, school closures and rising recession risks. These are vulnerabilities that Republicans have exploited during the campaign (while offering no solutions of their own, of course). Democrats have also convinced themselves that pet policies beloved by left-wing Twitter activists will be broadly 'popular' even when polls suggested public opinion is mixed at best," she said. "Such is the case with President Biden’s massive student debt forgiveness plan. The issue has been featured more often in Republican campaign ads this cycle than Democratic ones, according to AdImpact. Maybe voters will ignore these missteps and be persuaded by Democrats’ dire warnings about the risks to reproductive rights and democracy if Republicans retake Congress. But if there is cause for Democrats to conduct a political autopsy... the bottomless well of denial each deserve their own chapters."
In The New Republic, Alex Shephard said the results of the midterms will just confirm everyone's prior narratives.
"The truth is that midterms are nearly as predictable as death and taxes: The party that controls the White House always loses and often badly at that," Shephard wrote. "Following the predictable results will be the predictable protracted fallout, in which various interest groups and ideological factions will demand that the party could have escaped their fate—if it had only adopted their own set of policy preferences and messaging quirks. On Monday, the centrist Third Way got a jumpstart, releasing a memo warning that the Democratic Party’s brand is toxic. ‘If Democrats manage to hold on to the House and Senate, it will be in spite of the party brand, not because of it,’ the memo reads. Sure, why not? But what to do? Why, adopt the milquetoast pro-corporate messaging pushed by Third Way, of course!
"This is something that you will undoubtedly hear a lot as Democrats lick their wounds following the midterms: The party is simply too woke, too progressive. It’s lost touch with white working-class voters. It is in the thrall of its activist wing," he said. "It cares too much about policing speech and not enough about pocketbook issues. This is more or less what the party’s centrist wing has been saying for as long as anyone can remember and somehow it’s not enough that the party’s standard-bearer is a nigh-upon-octogenarian centrist who remembers the era of working hand-in-hand with segregationist conservatives with fondness... Naturally, once you start scratching the surface, it becomes hard to discern what, if anything, from the perspective of Third Way, went wrong with the way that Biden and Democrats have actually governed."

My take. 
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	All signs — historical and current polling — point to a very good night for Republicans.
	•	There is at least one counter-narratives to this out there worth sharing.
	•	Be patient, be calm, and let's see what actual results look like. 
I've said it a lot before and will say it again now: I don't love making predictions, and I don’t put myself in that business… with the exception of when I published 19 predictions about the future (subscribers-only). I think the prediction economy among columnists and reporters often produces absurd and ridiculous notions about what might happen — with everyone trying to win attention from readers and viewers with hotter takes and snappier “owns” on the “other side.” I do appreciate the many sources — like RealClearPolitics, FiveThirtyEight and Cook Political Report, among others — who try to make data-driven, scientific guesses about how an election will play out.
This election does not seem particularly complicated to me. It's a midterm election, inflation is high, Biden's approval ratings are low, and Democrats are likely to lose a lot of House seats and probably the Senate, too. Historically, the party in the White House loses 28 House seats and four Senate seats, on average. Democrats' saving grace is that in several of the most important Senate races, there are Republican candidates that appeal strongly to base voters on the right but have very high disapproval ratings among moderates and independents. It's possible that saves them a Senate majority, but I think it is unlikely.
One of the few voices I've seen bucking the trend of a big night for Republicans is Simon Rosenberg, who I think at least deserves a shout out here for the sake of diversity of opinion. He is an unabashed progressive working for a progressive organization, but his final midterm update — "I'd rather be us than them" — is uniquely bullish on Democrats. His theory rests mostly on the data we have: Democrats are outpacing early vote numbers from 2020, many late polls have looked good for them, and Hispanic and youth polling are all trending nicely for Democrats. If Democrats manage to hold the Senate or mitigate losses in the House, his analysis will prove prescient and unique.
The most interesting thing about this election is just how much the two sides are talking past each other. I wrote a few weeks ago that there are essentially two concurrent elections happening: One (from Republicans) focused on crime, inflation and immigration. The other (from Democrats) focused on abortion, democracy and Ukraine. There are exceptions — some candidates have made trans issues or election security or potential social security cuts key to their campaigns. But broadly, this is what each side is focusing on. There are always different party priorities, but this year seems unique in how infrequently the major political parties are grappling with the same issues at the same time.
As we head into election day, we should be patient for results and cognizant of certain dynamics about how these results play out. In Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, you can expect Republicans to have an early lead that narrows as more mail-in votes are counted. In Georgia, we may not have a senator until a December runoff. In New York, House races could take days to resolve. It's not ideal, but it is the system we're stuck with for now.
I also caution you all to be wary of late counts on mail in ballots and the predictable claims of fraud or nefarious activity. I have written extensively and repeatedly about allegations of election fraud, and how we know the vast majority of them are nonsense. Please do your best not to get caught up in rumors and innuendo, and don’t amplify unsubstantiated claims.
I'm sure by this time tomorrow there will be a lot more to say about all these races. But for now, my final and most important message is to go vote.

Your questions, answered.
Q: What do you think would be the perfect voting system? Some thoughts: Several days and several methods to vote, eliminate gerrymandering, every legal voter is required to cast a ballot, ranked-choice voting, no more attacking political ads (can only promote yourself and ads will be fact checked for misinformation or misleading information), etc?
— Jeff from Conshohocken, Pennsylvania
Tangle: This is a great question. I have some ideas that are a little half-baked, but roughly speaking I'd want something like this:
	•	Three days of voting (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) with Tuesday a national holiday for election day. I think the extra days of voting would be worth the cost.
	•	Voter ID laws passed concurrently with a bill that provides government issued IDs to any citizen who doesn't have them (free of cost).
	•	Mail-in voting is allowed for two weeks before an election, and those votes are processed before election day so results can be determined quickly on election night.
	•	No compulsory voting. It is okay to sit out. Even though I disagree with the choice not to participate, I don't like the idea of people being fined or criminalized for not voting.
	•	I’m starting to really like ranked-choice voting. And I would vote to support it if I could. But I think voters should decide whether they want it or not, via ballot initiative.
	•	Eliminating gerrymandering would be great — though figuring out the right way to redistrict "fairly" is very difficult.
	•	I don’t think there should be limits on attack ads, or fact-checking of political ads. Banning attack ads would be an infringement on free speech, and “fact-checking” would require unbiased government-run authorities that could never be truly unbiased, and could edge scarily into creating a “government-authorized truth”.

Under the radar. 
The Justice Department announced that it will be dispatching workers to 64 jurisdictions in 24 states on Election Day to help ensure they are in compliance with federal law. That is nearly 50% more than the 44 jurisdictions that had workers present in 2020. The DOJ is sending employees from its Civil Rights Division and other units to areas where they anticipate there will be disputes and tension around the voting process, including Clark County, Nevada; Pinal County, Arizona; Berks County, Pennsylvania; and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin; all areas where there were disputes in 2020 or new laws passed to monitor voters in 2022. The Washington Post has the story.

Numbers.
	•	0.4%. Republican Mehmet Oz's advantage over Democrat John Fetterman in an average of polls on the Pennsylvania Senate race, according to RealClearPolitics.
	•	+1.4%. Republican Herschel Walker's advantage over Democrat Raphael Warnock in an average of polls on the Georgia Senate race, according to RealClearPolitics.
	•	+3.4%. Republican Adam Laxalt's advantage over Democrat Cortez Masto in an average of polls on the Arizona Senate race, according to RealClearPolitics.
	•	9.9 million. The total number of registered Democrats who have voted already, according to data from states that track registration of early votes.
	•	7.8 million. The total number of registered Republicans who have voted already, according to data from states that track registration of early votes.

Every time the Birmingham, Alabama resident gets a paycheck, she puts aside a little money for random acts of kindness — a project she calls Sowing On Purpose. Thomas works as an assistant manager at a convenience store, and says she believes in unconditional love and kindness. So she uses the money to run games and help spread the love. For instance, she'll ask people on Facebook to guess a color or number, and whoever guesses correctly gets a free meal or tank of gas. "There is so much going on, and this is just showing love and blessing somebody just because," Thomas said. USA Today has the story.

Hang heavy curtains over your windows
Use heavy curtains or drapes to keep the cold out and the heat in, especially at night.

Today's read: 12 minutes.
🇧🇷
Today, we're covering the return of Lula. We also have a reader question about how to prepare for the midterms, a contest to see what reader can guess where I am, and the results of our poll from last week.

On the road...
It's election week and I'm on the road. Shoot me a reply to this email with a guess on where I am (city and state), and I'll send a free Tangle hoodie to the first reader who guesses correctly (answers will not be accepted from family and friends, who may have insider information). Tomorrow, I'll reveal the answer and the winner. Good luck!
 

Poll results.
Last week, we asked readers what they wanted us to cover in Tangle. Several readers wrote in asking to see the results, curious what the Tangle community picked, so we've published them below. I was surprised to see how high Brazil's election ranked, which is why we are covering it today (even though it’s last week’s news):
 

Quick hits.
	1.	Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears poised to return to power after his conservative coalition won a majority in Israel's parliament. (The return)
	2.	Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton is telling donors he does not plan to run for president in 2024. (The announcement)
	3.	Twitter is rolling out "Twitter Blue," a service that requires users to pay $7.99 per month for a blue verification check mark. Separately, the company is now asking some fired workers to return to the office. (Twitter blue)
	4.	Sean "Diddy" Combs has acquired cannabis companies in New York, Massachusetts and Illinois for an estimated $185 million. (The purchase)

Today's topic.
Brazil. Last week, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defeated incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro in a tight race. "Lula," as he is often called, managed to edge Bolsonaro with 50.9% of the vote to Bolsonaro's 49.1%, winning by a little more than two million votes, the closest election in Brazil's history. Lula’s margin of victory was fewer votes than the number of nullified ballots. Bolsonaro became the first president in Brazil to fail to win re-election in the 25 years since a constitutional amendment first made re-election possible.
Last week's final tally came after Bolsonaro outperformed polls in the first round of voting, where da Silva won 48% of the vote to Bolsonaro's 43%. With neither candidate hitting 50%, they faced off again in a runoff.
Da Silva, 77, was first elected president of Brazil 20 years ago, and last served from 2003 to 2010. His return to office is the culmination of a remarkable political comeback after being imprisoned for corruption in 2018. While da Silva is often described as a "leftist" politician, he has vowed during this campaign to work with centrist and moderate parties during his tenure.
Bolsonaro, a nationalist and right-wing president, will exit office after four years. His presidency was marred by his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic, in which Brazil's economy cratered and nearly 700,000 Brazilians died. He also oversaw the worst run of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in 15 years. However, he won many Brazilians over by defending conservative values in the country and positioning himself as a bulwark against the left-wing politics of the past. Heading into the election, he warned voters that the race may be derailed by election fraud.
Da Silva, meanwhile, previously oversaw a massive social welfare program that elevated tens of millions of Brazilians to the middle class. When he left office in 2010, he had an 80% approval rating. However, his reputation was tarnished after being arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for 580 days over corruption and money laundering convictions. His party, the Workers Party, was caught in a cash-for-votes scandal, while da Silva and numerous other Latin American politicians were caught up in a scheme where large companies were paying off politicians in exchange for government projects.
Initially, those charges would have prevented Lula from running for office again. However, in 2019, the journalist Glenn Greenwald published leaked documents that showed the judge overseeing the case was passing on investigative leads and advice to prosecutors. Some began describing da Silva as a political prisoner, and Brazil's top court eventually nullified the charges, citing the bias of the judge. That ruling allowed da Silva to run for president for the sixth time.
While campaigning this year, da Silva once again pledged to focus on the poor — saying he would raise the minimum wage and increase spending on poverty.
While nationalist sentiment is ascending in Europe and other parts of the world, da Silva's victory is symbolic of a much different reality in Latin America. With recent leftist victories in Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Peru, every major economy in Latin America will now be led by a leftist government when da Silva takes office on January 1.
Though Da Silva prevailed in the election, challenges remain in governance. Scores of Bolsonaro allies won races in Congress across the country, and Brazil is deeply divided. China, one of Brazil's biggest trading partners, is also undergoing an economic slowdown. Some 33 million Brazilians (of 215 million) are living in poverty. Da Silva is going to have to win over many opponents in order to implement key parts of his agenda, like eliminating the income tax for anyone earning less than $950 a month and increasing taxes on the rich.
Today, we're going to take a look at some reactions to his victory from the left and right, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left is hopeful about Lula's return, but worried about what it might mean for the war in Ukraine.
	•	Most express relief Bolsonaro is gone.
	•	Some praise Brazil for a peaceful transfer of power, despite Bolsonaro’s initial silence.
In CNN, Arick Wierson said Brazil is bidding farewell to the "Trump of the tropics."
"On one hand, Lula’s victory marked a sharp rebuke of Bolsonaro’s irreverent and often-times controversial governing style, which earned him the derisive moniker as the ‘Trump of the Tropics.’ Not only was Bolsonaro in fact endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, but like Trump, he was widely criticized for his handling of the coronavirus which resulted in nearly 700,000 deaths in the country, according to the World Health Organization. Moreover, Bolsonaro’s aggressive anti-LGBT agenda, decidedly anti-environmental policies and authoritarian tendencies made him something of a pariah in the international media," Wierson said.
"The bad news is that, now come January 1, when Lula is sworn in for his third term as President, he will have to find a way to govern a country that is deeply divided and highly mistrustful of the other side," Wierson said. "Unlike in his past victories where Lula came into office with a clear mandate, winning over 60% of the votes in both 2002 and 2006, this time not only did Lula eke out the slimmest of victories, but he will face a congress that is still very much aligned with Bolsonaro. Moreover, with the down-ballot results of Sunday’s run-off elections for governorships across the country, it’s clear that allies of Bolsonaro will be in power in 14 of Brazil’s 27 states including the most economically important states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais."
In The Washington Post, Mac Margolis said this was a win for the center.
"Rather than careen left to counter Bolsonaro’s extremism, [Lula] yanked his campaign hard toward the middle," Margolis said. "The result was an unlikely coalition that gathered under a single tent establishment economists, disillusioned centrists and the hard left. Lula named as his running mate former São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, a center-right social democrat. He reeled in Simone Tebet, a former presidential hopeful from the conservative Brazilian Democratic Movement Party who had long criticized Lula and the corruption that flourished during about 14 years of Workers’ Party (PT) governments.
"Lula’s return will not guarantee governability or the end of political loathing and conflict," he added. "The array of political forces he has coalesced will prove challenging to hold together, much less lead. Governing Brazil calls for power-sharing, which is too often a fast pass to corruption. It also demands fiscal sobriety — a challenge in a country recovering from the pandemic, where legislators are practiced in holding presidents to ransom. Leftist partisans can rightly celebrate their unprecedented democratic coalition as a firewall against right-wing extremism. Yet to hold that compact together Lula will need to summon all his pragmatism and political acumen, both conspicuously absent in Bolsonaro’s Brazil."
In MSNBC, Julio Ricardo Varela said that despite the warnings of Bolsonaro refusing to accept a loss, Brazil's democracy looks more stable than America's.
"However, Bolsonaro's agreeing to a peaceful transfer of power hasn’t stopped noted American 'Stop the Steal' election deniers from calling for a military coup in Brazil to protect Bolsonaro," Varela said. "On Sunday, once it was clear that Bolsonaro would not catch up to Lula’s lead, far-right election denier Ali Alexander was urging the 'brothers of Brazil' to 'take to the streets' with a 'military standby,' noting on Truth Social, with no evidence at all, that 'Joe Biden’s team is currently STEALING the Brazilian election for socialist Lula. Literally a COUP.' Alexander was demanding an audit of the vote, a baseless trope being regurgitated by the likes of right-wingers Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson.
"Like an even more twisted statement of manifest destiny, the United States has had a shameful history of bulldozing through the political wishes of its southern neighbors while all the time boasting that it believes in democracy and that democracy here is better than democracy anywhere else," Varela added. "Meddling in Latin America’s political affairs and sometimes propping up dictators while purporting to be a lover of democracy has always been an obvious American hypocrisy. But there is a particular irony here in watching American conservatives, who used to boast that America’s chief export is democracy, rally to export election denialism."

What the right is saying.
	•	Many on the right say Brazil could be in trouble, and worry about the left-wing takeover of Latin America.
	•	Some argue that Bolsonaro got results but failed to sell them to the public.
	•	Others criticize the Biden administration and Brazil's government for silencing questions about the election.
The Wall Street Journal said Brazil is "gambling again" on a leftward turn.
"Mr. da Silva, who served two presidential terms from 2003-2010, won with his appeals to the poor despite his conviction for corruption," the board said. "Before his Workers’ Party (PT) ceded power in 2016, it orchestrated the largest corruption scheme in Latin American history, using the national development bank, the state-owned oil company, Congress and private contractors. The money machine was designed to entrench his party in power. Mr. da Silva and his accomplices were caught only because prosecutors found a money trail, and an honest judge allowed them to follow it—a minor miracle given Brazilian history. Lula’s 2017 corruption conviction was overturned on a technicality but he was never exonerated.
"The pandemic made change harder, but [Bolsonaro's] government achieved significant deregulation and fiscal reform. He spent liberally to sustain businesses and households during peak Covid-19, but he later cut spending by paring credit subsidies to agriculture and industry, slowing the growth of social assistance and reducing government payrolls," it added. "Fiscal restraint took pressure off the central bank, and inflation has been coming down. At about 7% it’s now lower than in the U.S. Mr. Bolsonaro had a good economic story but he struggled to tell it against the media and elites who disliked his social conservatism and portrayed him as a threat to democracy. His shoot-from-the-lip rhetoric didn’t help and was especially unpopular with women. While Amazon deforestation continued in his presidency, its pace was faster in Lula’s first four-year term. Yet Mr. Bolsonaro was tagged as an enemy of the rain forest."
In The Washington Examiner, Lawrence J. Haas said Lula could pose some serious challenges for the United States.
"Lula’s victory will nourish a growing challenge for the United States," Haas wrote. "It means that the region’s seven largest countries now all have leftist governments. Washington will not be able to navigate regional politics through its traditional strategy of trying to isolate far-left regimes. This U.S. challenge, moreover, comes as China, Russia, and Iran — a growing axis of anti-American activity — are increasing their economic, military, and diplomatic influence across the region... Lula’s victory could further nourish China’s regional influence since he likely will be more enthused about Chinese-Brazilian ties than was Bolsonaro. Russia, too, is working more closely with authoritarian governments in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba.
"Once upon a time, U.S. policy toward Central and South America focused heavily on isolating the far Left, whether the Castro regime in Cuba for decades, Nicaragua’s Sandinistas in the 1980s, or the autocrats in Venezuela more recently. With Lula’s victory, however, Washington faces a growing risk of its own hemispheric isolation," he wrote. "Driven by the economic distress imposed by COVID-19, voters across South America have taken a consistently leftist turn in recent years… To be sure, Lula’s victory gives Washington and Brasilia opportunities for cooperation, particularly on environmental issues, since he supports strong action to combat climate change and almost certainly will reverse Bolsonaro’s policies enabling deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Still, Lula’s victory will further complicate Washington’s approach to the region."
On Fox News, Tucker Carslon said there are two reasons you should care about what is happening in Brazil.
"The first is that the result of this election will determine the extent of China's influence in the Western Hemisphere," he said. "If Bolsonaro is determined the loser and da Silva does become the president of Brazil, that means that left-wing governments loyal to China outside of our sphere of influence will control all of South America. Brazil was the last holdout, also the biggest and most significant country in South America. Bolsonaro, alone in South America, stood in the way of total Chinese hegemony there. It's our hemisphere.
"The second reason you should be paying attention to this is that the crackdown on free speech in the wake of Brazil's contested election is a result of policies from our country," Carlson said. "The Biden administration has already announced that Bolsonaro lost and then threatened Bolsonaro with consequences if he tries to contest the result of the election in his country. The State Department, the Biden State Department, put out a statement saying that Bolsonaro's defeat "reinforces" trust in democratic institutions. Really? This is an election that is contested. The demonstrations in the streets prove that. That has not been audited. That apparently cannot be audited by fiat and that you’re not allowed to talk about. How does that restore your faith in institutions? No. Only one thing restores your faith in institutions and that's transparency."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	Lula is a mixed bag for the U.S.
	•	It's a positive development for climate change, and the peaceful transfer of power is good for stability in Brazil while undermining allegations of election fraud.
	•	It could get complicated given Lula's attitude toward Russia and China.
Whenever there are major political changes in a country that the United States operates closely with, there are always a few framing thoughts I like to consider. How does this political leader view the U.S., and how will their policies immediately impact us? How does this leader work with U.S. allies and adversaries, and will their rise "help" or "hurt" us? And what kind of imminent, potent political issues in the U.S. will be impacted by these changes?
Notably absent from this framing is what this means for Brazil and its people. Which is intentional. I think if i were to opine here about what da Silva's victory will mean for Brazilians or how they should feel, it would be an act of hubris too great even for someone who shares their opinion publicly on the news five days a week. I don't know or understand Brazil's domestic politics nearly well enough to take a position there, and there are plenty of other writers more qualified than I am to share those thoughts.
What I can share are some reactions on how Lula's return relates specifically to the U.S.
The good: For starters, the transfer of power is happening peacefully and with little upset. Why does this matter? Because many right-wing commentators here in the U.S. have been rattling the cages on purported fraud, and because this election is a reminder of how to navigate those allegations. There were five million votes that were purposely left blank or spoiled by voters, according to reports on the ground, so there are naturally going to be a lot of questions. But so far there is little evidence (that I've seen) of any impropriety.
In the same vein, it's impossible to say for sure why Bolsonaro is not challenging the results as some expected he might, but the obvious hypothesis is that he is isolated. His allies are not rallying around calls to upend the democratic process — they're simply preparing to fight da Silva's presidency via democratic means. However you feel about da Silva, that is good news for democracy.
This is also good for the climate fight. Da Silva has been steadfast in his support for protecting the Amazon rainforest, which — believe it or not — is crucial not just to Brazil's ecosystem but also the planet's. This is not a fight over how sustainable electric vehicles are or how much greenhouse gas emissions a country should have. It's simpler than that. The Amazon is a huge carbon sink for the planet, absorbing heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in biomass. Along with preserving its millions of unique species, simply protecting it from deforestation will benefit all of us in the long term.
So that's the good news.
The bad? Well, da Silva's last term oversaw widespread corruption throughout Brazil. Whether he was directly involved or not — and the degree of his culpability — is still debated in some circles. What is not debatable is that when he was president, corruption thrived. Corruption breeds distrust from the people, and distrust breeds unrest. Unrest in Brazil would be bad for Latin America and bad for us. In those simple, crude terms, da Silva is a risky president.
It's also true that in the new world alignment we are witnessing, it's likely that Lula will draw closer to Russia, China, and Iran. He has long said he viewed Zelensky "as responsible as Putin" for the war in Ukraine, and plenty of columnists view Lula's victory as great news for Putin. Campaigning in wartime is different from leading, so we'll see what Lula actually does and what influence he has, but there is no doubt he could join a growing list of countries that stand in opposition to the U.S. position on the war. His election means China's influence in Latin America is almost certain to grow, which could threaten certain interests the U.S. has — especially when it comes to competition for the ever-more-valuable lithium needed to power batteries.
All told, it's a decidedly mixed bag.

Your questions, answered.
Q: Is there any place you recommend to get a relatively unbiased view of candidates on my 2022 midterm ballot? I started to fill out my ballot in advance, but it’s a lot of effort to Google 50+ people for smaller positions that I haven’t heard about.
— Rob from Austin, Texas
Tangle: I get this question a lot. The truth is there are not a ton of great unbiased resources out there like this, despite such a massive demand for them. I think part of the reason it's so hard to find in one place is that there are just so many candidates and races. For instance, there are 435 representatives in the House up for election every two years — which implies at least 870 candidates, and usually more when you take into account third party candidates and others.
Then there are governor's races, state legislature races, local city races, and more. So one website would have to host tens of thousands of candidate profiles (in an unbiased manner) all in one spot. It's a huge task.
But there are plenty of good resources out there. For starters, there are apps and websites like Ballotpedia (where you can view your own personalized sample ballot), ActiVote, and OnTheIssues, all of which try to pool together information about specific candidates and ballot initiatives. This is a good place to start. Figure out who is on the ballot and what issues are in play.
Then, I'd check your local papers. Local news outlets still do an admirable job keeping you apprised of what each candidate stands for and how they may impact your day-to-day life. Combined with the resources above, you should be able to get a clear picture of what is going on. My advice: Put aside an hour today or early tomorrow and just do the digging if you haven't yet. It isn't easy, but a little legwork is definitely worth it.

Under the radar.
President Biden's top national security adviser Jake Sullivan has been engaged in confidential conversations with top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin over the last few months. The Wall Street Journal is citing U.S. and allied officials, who say the previously undisclosed talks have been taking place in an effort to reduce the risk of a broader conflict in Europe and ensure that Moscow does not use nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction. The White House has not acknowledged any communications between Sullivan and senior Russian officials since March, and both sides have declined to confirm or deny the report. The Wall Street Journal has the story (paywall).

Numbers.
	•	One. The number of days until election day.
	•	40,786,501. The number of early votes cast, as of Monday morning.
	•	44%. The percentage of registered voters who said they believe “The federal government is controlled by a secret cabal.”
	•	37%. The percentage of Democrats who said they believe that.
	•	53%. The percentage of Republicans who said they believe that.
	•	54 in 100. The number of times Republicans win the Senate in FiveThirtyEight's 40,000 simulations of the 2022 midterms.

Have a nice day. 
415 million people have been lifted out of poverty in India over the last 15 years, according to the United Nations. The incidence of poverty dropped from 55.1% in 2005-2006 to 16.4% in 2019-2021, a new report says, indicating one of the most remarkable drops in poverty ever recorded. While the effects of Covid-19 on poverty cannot yet be calculated, analysts are hopeful much of the progress will remain. India focused on four poverty reduction programs to achieve its goal: Sustainable livelihood programs through natural resources (like farming), girls’ education, rural development, and better funding for civil society development programs. The Economic Times has the story.

A couple of years ago, I took the Ancestry.com dna test. I just received an updated DNA origin profile. I lost 1% of my "Irishness". It used to be 4%. These updates are due to Ancestry getting more people's samples and that should make it more accurate. 

There is Irish DNA going back to the viking era in Iceland. Legend has it that some vikings took Irish women home with them during their raids. Iceland was mainly settled by Norwegian immigrants in the 10th century. We also have lines that go back to Swedish settlers as well. 

Grandma Paula's heritage traces back to England and Wales. This includes a Mayflower passenger and many British converts that joined the LDS church and immigrated to the USA. One line includes people that left England for religious freedom and joined the Hugenots. Brad Haymond has done extensive genealogical research and is a great resource for any questions. Sara and I recently passed through the town of Manlius NY where Daniel Stanton was born (see D&C 75:33) while visiting upstate NY. 

There are so many amazing people and family history stories from the Myres, Vatnsdals, Haymonds, and Averetts.  Grandpa and Grandma Myres have shared lots of family history stories that I recommend reading when you all have the opportunity.

Down to the Wire...
 
Tomorrow is election day. We are running down to the wire, and are not letting up. The most important thing for us now is voter turnout. Get your friends and neighbors to turn in their ballots at a drop box or get out to a same day polling location. 
Visit: vote.utah.gov to find a same day polling location or where to submit your ballot. 
IF YOU ARE MAILING YOUR BALLOT IT MUST BE POSTMARKED BY TODAY NOVEMBER 7TH. 
 
 
Why vote?
 
This mug was given to me by a friend of mine. Although it is in jest, it also rings with truth. We worry about our families, our friends and neighbors. Well, the current Democrat policy is making everyone's lives harder. Record inflation caused by unending spending, gas and groceries at record highs because of poor energy policy and retirement accounts sinking like a rock. This is not a mistake and didn't happen by accident. The Democratic policy is failing our Country, it is failing you. It is time that we expect more. We have a chance to turn this ship around, but it takes all of us! We are in this together, tomorrow is a turning point in this state and in the country. Let's do our part to make sure that Utah is the tip of that spear in getting this Country back on track. Get out and VOTE! Make certain that those you know do the same! 
We have some amazing Republican candidates around the state this year. We also have Senator Mike Lee at the top of the ballot. His opponent has refused to caucus with the Republican party while calling himself an "independent". Although he was more than willing to attend the Democratic state convention and encourage the Democratic Party of Utah to not nominate their own candidate and support him in this race. That doesn't sound independent to me. As Governor Ron Desantis said in a recent endorsement of Senator Lee. Speaking about McMullin he said, "He is a Donkey in sheep's clothing". 
We have the correct policy and the right ideas to get this country back on track. Let's make sure that is a reality, tomorrow November 8th!

The challenge this week is to VOTE.  The last day you can do this is tomorrow (Tuesday).
If you think the country, or the state, or the city are on the wrong track, the best way to do something about that is to vote.  Most college-age citizens don't vote.  If a lot more voted, they could completely change things.

Hi everyone,
I just finished grading and posting the scores for exam 2. Congratulations! The scores were super high and I am really proud of you. You did great as a class. 
The mean average was an 89.4% and a Median of 92%. The high score was 103% and several individuals scored over 100% on the exam. So again, great job on the exam. The scores were off the charts. 
These scores reflect the Study Guides and all points have been factored in, even if you don't see a score on LS. I have put them directly into the final scores for the exams.
Hope you are enjoying a wonderful weekend.
See you on Tuesday.

Today's topic.
Affirmative action. On Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases challenging the use of race-conscious admissions in colleges. During oral arguments, the conservative majority court appeared primed to strike down the use of race as a consideration in college admissions.
The cases: Both lawsuits now in front of the Supreme Court were filed in 2014 by a group called Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). The first, filed against Harvard, says the school was violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars entities that receive federal funding from racial discrimination. The plaintiffs argue that Asian Americans are less likely to be admitted than similarly qualified white, Black or Hispanic applicants under current Harvard admissions policies.
In the second case, the plaintiffs are arguing that the University of North Carolina violates the 14th amendment's equal protection clause, which bars racial discrimination by government entities, by considering race in its admissions process when such considerations are not necessary to create a diverse student body. Both universities prevailed in federal courts, but both cases were appealed to the Supreme Court.
The history: In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court struck down racial segregation in public schools, rejecting the idea that race could be used to influence educational opportunities. In 1978, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the court struck down a racial quota system in higher education, but left the door open for race-conscious admissions. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in Grutter v. Bollinger that the University of Michigan Law School could consider race in its admissions process as an attempt to create a diverse student body. In that case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor famously suggested in her opinion that in 25 years, the use of such preferences may not be necessary.
The arguments: In SCOTUSblog, Amy Howe broke down the oral arguments, in which the conservative justices focused on criticisms of the precedent that has allowed race-conscious admissions, and pressed lawyers defending affirmative action to explain the educational benefits of diversity. The justices also prodded at how the universities determine when they have diverse student bodies, whether the colleges will consider race indefinitely (which O'Connor never endorsed), and pointed to alternative ways to ensure a diverse student body, like more robust financial aid to low-income and first generation immigrant students.
The universities have responded by arguing that there is no race-neutral way to ensure a diverse student body that is more effective than considering race as part of applications. Lawyers representing the schools, as well as the liberal justices, stressed that race is just one of many considerations when a student applies to college, and that lower courts had already determined neither school had been guilty of discrimination.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who recently sat on the board of Harvard admissions, recused herself from the Harvard case. However, in the UNC case, she suggested that forbidding race considerations could create Constitutional violations. Jackson suggested a hypothetical where one student's family had attended UNC for generations and another student, who was Black, had no legacy at UNC because Black students were once barred from attending at all. “The first applicant would be able to have his family background considered and valued by the institution as part of its consideration of whether or not to admit him,” she suggested, "while the second one wouldn't." That, Jackson said, could be its own violation of the equal protection clause.
The outcome: This case will be decided sometime next year. Questioning from the justices suggested they are likely to overturn Grutter and Bakke, effectively ending the use of race-conscious admissions. However, lawyers representing the universities urged the justices to send the cases back to the lower courts if they did not believe they were sufficiently reviewed, and Justice Gorsuch appeared open to the idea of ruling in the two cases without weighing in on any constitutional issues.
Today, we'll take a look at some arguments from the left and right, then my take.

What the right is saying.
	•	The right is opposed to race-conscious admissions, and argues that it is time to strike down the use of affirmative action.
	•	Many criticize the practices of Harvard and UNC, arguing that they create discrimination against students of Asian descent.
	•	Some say affirmative action was once necessary, but there are better ways to create diverse campuses now.
In The New York Times, Renu Mukherjee, a first generation immigrant, argued that there are better ways for universities to foster diversity.
"The story of how my family arrived and found its way in America is a unique one that exemplifies diversity," Mukherjee wrote. "But based on revelations from Students for Fair Admissions’ challenge to Harvard and the University of North Carolina’s race-conscious admissions policies, cases that have oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Monday, it seems neither of these schools would agree with me. They, along with many other elite universities in the U.S., seem to have decided that because Asian American enrollment at their schools exceeds the Asian American share of the population, stories like mine don’t count as 'diverse.' Instead, the stories of 'underrepresented' racial minorities tend to count more as the diversity in which universities have a compelling interest, the rationale for racial preferences today.
"Racial preferences in college admissions are wrong, and not just because they make it more difficult for certain racial groups over others to gain admission," Mukherjee said. "Race-conscious admissions programs are wrong also because they promote the view that certain types of diversity matter more than others, that certain stories are more worth telling than others. This is obviously misguided. On a university campus, true diversity should encompass all aspects of a student’s personhood that could contribute to the educational environment, like whether the student is a spelling bee champion, grew up in a single-parent household, or worked in a New York pizza parlor. Indeed, this is what Justice Lewis Powell had in mind when he established the diversity rationale behind race-conscious admissions in 1978’s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke."
In The Federalist, Margot Cleveland said there is "no equal protection" if universities can rate skin color in admissions.
"In making admissions decisions, both Harvard and the University of North Carolina consider the race of applicants, with the schools advantaging American Indian, Hispanic, and black applicants to the disadvantage of Asian American students," Cleveland wrote. "The lawsuits proceeded to trial with the SFFA taking a two-prong approach, arguing both that Grutter was wrongly decided and should be overturned, and that the universities violated Grutter by giving race an 'undue' influence on admissions decisions by making race a 'minus' for Asian Americans and by adopting 'impermissible racial stereotypes' about Asian Americans, such as that they are 'timid, quiet, shy, passive, withdrawn, one-dimensional, hard workers, perpetual foreigners, and model minorities.’"
"The universities’ argument will likely fail… for several reasons," Cleveland said. "First, the laws providing for 'race-conscious' assistance were few and far between, and as the SFFA stresses, 'colorblind statutes from the era are more prevalent.' Second, the adoption of laws to benefit former slaves provides no guidance on whether the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause allows states to make race-conscious decisions for reasons other than to 'remedy past state-sponsored discrimination.' And third, as SFFA writes, 'none of the postbellum statutes are controlling because, for decades, this country largely disregarded the Fourteenth Amendment’s text. But that ‘text,’ not ‘post-ratification … laws that are inconsistent’ with it, ‘controls.’ ... as Chief Justice John Roberts said so simply, 'The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race, is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.'"
In The Dispatch, David French argued that racial discrimination is not the path to racial justice.
"As Richard Kahlenberg argued last week in The Atlantic, universities are keeping a 'dirty secret.' Racial preferences 'provide cover for an admissions system that mostly benefits the wealthy.' In other words, the universities preserve a longstanding status quo that privileges those individuals—legacy admittees and children of donors, for example—who preserve the university’s wealth and power while using race preferences as a blunt instrument to render universities 'diverse' along racial lines only," French said. "Here’s how the system works. Elite universities attempt to accomplish multiple goals at the same time. They want to maintain the community and financial benefits of legacy admissions and donor favoritism.
"They also want to maintain the high class GPA and SAT scores that are the foundations of college rankings," he wrote. "And they want their incoming classes to 'look like America.' The result—especially in elite academic circles—is extraordinarily pernicious... Harvard’s method was deeply disturbing. It systematically down-ranked Asian-American applicants’ 'personal rating.' At Harvard, the personal rating refers to highly subjective qualities like ‘integrity,’ ‘courage,’ ‘kindness,’ and ‘empathy.’ Here’s where the story gets worse: Although these personal qualities have nothing to do with race, Asian Americans receive by far the worst scores," French said. "Nor are those scores an innocent coincidence. The district court found 'a statistically significant and negative relationship between Asian American identity and the personal rating assigned by Harvard admissions officers.'"

What the left is saying.
	•	The left argues that the court should not overturn decades of precedent.
	•	Many say race-conscious admissions is still the best way to create diverse campuses.
	•	Others argue that the court is going to strike down affirmative action, regardless of how bad the arguments are.
The Washington Post editorial board said the Supreme Court should "follow precedent" on race-conscious admissions.
“Those challenging race-conscious admissions in this case do not argue that colleges and universities receive no benefits from building diverse student bodies. Rather, they claim that universities such as Harvard ‘award mammoth racial preferences to African Americans and Hispanics,’ while discriminating against Asian Americans, resulting in ‘anti-Asian stereotyping, race-obsessed campuses, declines in ideological diversity, and more.’ They also charge that universities could achieve sufficient diversity by giving more of an admissions ‘tip’ to students of low socioeconomic status. The universities — and two lower courts — disagreed with the challengers’ assertions...Underlying the arguments is a disagreement about the intent of the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.
“The challengers contend that the amendment requires the government and related entities adhere to strict racial neutrality. But the universities have the better argument, pointing out that those who wrote the 14th Amendment rejected language that would support such an absolutist reading. ‘Both state and federal authorities at the time enacted race-conscious measures to promote African Americans’ equal participation in society,’ they wrote. The amendment exists to enable Congress and other institutions to combat racial disparities — not as a directive to ignore them... The court has said that the circumstances under which race-conscious policies may proceed should be extremely narrow. But that is the most important point: The court has already spoken.”
In Slate, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern said the court has no reason to end affirmative action, but they probably will anyway.
“The history of affirmative action at the Supreme Court is not particularly complicated. In 1978’s Bakke decision, a majority found that universities could consider race to build a diverse student body, identifying educational benefits that flow from diversity,” they wrote. “At the same time, a majority prohibited quotas and other rigid metrics that reduced applicants to their race, requiring universities to undertake a holistic review of each applicant. The Supreme Court affirmed this principle in 2003’s Grutter v. Bollinger and again in 2016’s Fisher v. Texas... So, in theory, the justices should’ve been debating the meaning of the Constitution. Instead, the conservative justices continually reverted to free-floating policy discussions about how affirmative action makes them feel. (Hint: They feel bad.)
“Justice Samuel Alito took a wholly gratuitous potshot at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, asking whether someone counts as a racial minority if their ‘family lore’ claims American Indian heritage,” they said. “Justice Clarence Thomas asserted that affirmative action is indistinguishable from Jim Crow and argued that ‘diversity’ itself is an empty, meaningless concept. “I don’t have a clue what it means,” Thomas said. When North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park explained that students benefit from having classmates with different backgrounds and viewpoints, offering peer-reviewed research on the topic, the justice retorted: ‘I don’t put much stock in that because I’ve heard similar arguments in favor of segregation, too’—as though Southern states had once defended Jim Crow as necessary to expose students to the lived experiences of their classmates.”
In The Los Angeles Times, Sally Chen, a Harvard graduate, said affirmative action helped her — even as an Asian American.
"I am the daughter of working-class Chinese immigrants who speak very little English. I was born at Chinese Hospital and grew up in Lower Nob Hill in San Francisco. My parents worked at restaurants for low wages, and our family of six barely scraped by," she said. "We lived in a cramped one-bedroom apartment among urban professionals and underserved communities. Before I was even a teenager, I advocated and translated for my family. In my household, my siblings and I are the first generation to graduate from college. In my personal statement for my college application to Harvard, I wrote about how these experiences shaped my passion to do work that would help others with similar struggles.
"At a student activism meeting in 2017, a friend shared how to file requests under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to see my admissions file," Chen wrote. "My admissions readers saw value and authenticity in my perspective: 'Categorized as low-income and with Taiwanese-speaking parents, she relates to the plight of the outsiders in Ralph Ellison and William Faulkner.'  Though my test scores were far from perfect, they believed that I had the potential to make a ‘contribution to college life’ that would be ‘truly unusual.’ I benefited from an admissions process that took race and the effects of racism into consideration. My story can’t be conveyed in a race-blind way and during the Harvard trial my admissions file was used as an exhibit to illustrate this."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	I'd prefer race wasn't a significant consideration in college admissions.
	•	That doesn't mean I think prohibiting it is the right call, or legally justified.
	•	Nothing in this case is going to fix or destroy our broken university system. 
Obviously, this is not a simple issue. On the one hand, the need for affirmative action should not be hard to comprehend. When you completely box out non-whites from educational opportunities for hundreds of years, you can't simply say, "ok, you're allowed in now," and call that fair. Lyndon Johnson's famous quote encapsulates the absurdity of this mentality:
''You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair. Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.''
The original need for race-conscious admissions was obvious: To reverse centuries of injustice, it would be helpful if there were a tool that allowed colleges to at least consider race. This was doubly true when college administrators began to recognize the benefits of diverse campuses not just for minorities, but for white students as well.
On the other hand, in the last couple of decades, affirmative action has become extremely complicated and convoluted and, at times, has been a form of negative prejudice in and of itself. The Harvard case is a tremendous example of how this manifests. Asian-Americans, on paper, should be admitted at higher rates than whites. Average measurable factors like GPA and test scores among Asians are stronger than white applicants. Yet Harvard's admission process has been able to stymie that obvious outcome — in fact, they have been motivated to stymie it — through the use of personal ratings that systematically devalue Asian applicants.
The trap of race-conscious admissions was always obvious, too. As affirmative action policies achieved their goal, and the country became more equal, with wealth and educational disparities closing, Black or other minority students would have a leg up on white counterparts who were equally disadvantaged from birth. So, too, would the children of beneficiaries of those policies 60 years ago more so than students currently at a lower economic station. This is why O’Connor predicted (or, more aptly, hoped) that one day it wouldn’t be necessary.
In my own life, I've seen the multitudinous applications of diversity and how they differ. For instance, my high school was very economically diverse — but not very racially diverse. My wife's high school was very racially diverse, but not very economically diverse. Her high school class is, on average, much wealthier and more liberal — and a lot less white than mine. My high school class is, on average, less wealthy, much more politically diverse, and much more white. In my view, there would be a huge benefit to having a campus with a mix of our childhood friends, and a huge downside to having any campus that mirrored either of our high schools entirely.
The hardest thing about race-conscious admissions, though, is that it is trying to solve a problem it can't.
Simply put: Colleges, especially elite schools, are refusing to expand their student bodies while the pool of applicants keeps growing. Economist Noah Smith recently noted that Stanford accepted 16% of applicants when he was accepted. Now they take just 4%. Using race-conscious admissions policies is supposed to ensure that an ever-smaller, more elite group of students is ever-more diverse and representative of the country. The inevitable result, as colleges get more competitive, is that more students are going to be boxed out because of their race, rather than given a leg up.
To put it differently: When Harvard is getting applicant pools like this...
 
Harvard University 
@Harvard
 
Fact check: In a recent admissions cycle there were:
2,000 available slots at Harvard College
8,000 U.S. applicants with perfect GPAs
4,000+ applicants ranked 1st in their high school classes
18,000+ scored 700+ on SAT reading/writing
20,000+ scored 700+ on SAT math

... the likely outcome, if it wants to keep a racially representative student body, is that race will suddenly become a major part of determining whether a student gets in or not. The solution isn't just to get rid of race-conscious admissions, which I do think colleges should consider, but it's to dramatically expand the pool of students we're letting into colleges.
In my perfect world, colleges would focus primarily on wealth and income status, with secondary considerations for things like immigration status, language use, or (my own biases) even political diversity to fill out college campuses. Race would still play a small role, but would be superseded by many of these other considerations. Some analyses have shown that simply solving for economic disparities would also at least approach solving for racial diversity (which is paradoxically the reason for race-conscious admissions and proof we may not need them). Things like "legacy" would be thrown out the window entirely.
Unfortunately, that perfect world is nowhere near happening. College is essentially a racket, and the most elite schools now need to admit legacy students (keep the donors coming) and churn out student bodies that are sufficiently diverse based on what race students check off in their applications, but also rich enough to cough up tuition fees. All the while, race is an increasingly arbitrary measurement as the definitions of “Hispanic” and “Asian” are drawn on fabricated lines and more and more mixed race students join the fray.
Of course, this is a legal battle, not a hypothetical of how I think colleges should be run. In that regard, it seems to me the universities should have the upper hand. They have decades of precedent on their side, and — from an "originalist" perspective — the obvious historical context that the 14th amendment was race-conscious. It’s quite jarring to see the conservative justices who claim to be originalists ignore this historical fact. The very aim of the drafters was to address inequalities affecting Black Americans, and I find it hard to believe opening more doors onto college campuses wouldn't qualify in their eyes.
The complicating factor, obviously, is that doesn't mean race can exclude certain people from college campuses. When it functions as a barrier and a determinative factor, it should be illegal — meaning policies like the one at Harvard may not pass muster. As Justice Jackson's hypothetical made clear, I also don't think we're far enough removed from systematic racial oppression to outlaw race-conscious admissions entirely. If something like legacy status still plays a role in admissions, then race is playing a de facto role in admissions, whether we like it or not. It’s that simple.
I wish schools would consider race less, I definitely wish schools would consider legacies a whole lot less, and I think there are more rewarding elements of diversity for college campuses to consider; but I also don't think they should be prohibited from considering race at all. Even by the conservatives justices’ regularly-cited Sandra Day O’Connor quote, we’re still a few years away from her rather arbitrary 25- year timeline (which arrives in 2028).
Whatever the outcome, I feel confident saying this much: This case isn’t going to fix or destroy elite universities. Their exorbitant costs, unchecked nepotism and absurdly small class sizes will do that on their own, regardless of whether admissions boards are considering race or not.

Your questions, answered.
Q: In your entire analysis there is not one mention of the horrific call to violence perpetrated by Senate Majority Leader Schumer. I mean really, where is your research? He basically called for an all out attack on the Supreme Court if they dared to touch Roe v Wade. I’m a first time subscriber to your newsletter and remain underwhelmed by your “balanced” reviews.
— Kevin from Machipongo, Virginia
Tangle: Yesterday's issue was about the attack on Paul Pelosi. Of course, it was about dangerous political rhetoric, too, and I thought it was more pertinent to cite the rhetoric from Nancy Pelosi herself as exemplary of aggressive language from the left than involve Chuck Schumer. When we covered the threats to Kavanaugh's life, we included arguments about Schumer's rhetoric.
For whatever it's worth, newsletters like yesterday's inevitably get dozens of replies that involve some version of "I can't believe you didn't cite this..." or "How could you not mention that..." Obviously, space in Tangle is finite, which means there is always going to be valuable context and interesting opinions left out. A better framework should be: What do you think I should have removed in order to make space for this argument or context you think wasn't properly included?
Then you get to enter my world!

Under the radar.
The Department of Justice says it has taken down a catalytic converter theft ring that generated hundreds of millions of dollars. If you're a car owner, you have probably heard warnings about your catalytic converter being stolen. Catalytic converters are a valuable part of a car's exhaust system, easy to steal, and rife with valuable metals like palladium and rhodium. They have been going missing in droves across the country. Now, 21 defendants are being charged in an operation that led to arrests in California, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia. The Los Angeles Times has the story.

William Goode, a 97-year-old World War II veteran, is getting treated to a tour of his favorite activities thanks to the YouTube creator Isaiah Garza. Last month, Garza went viral after he took Goode on a trip to Disneyland as a surprise. When the positive attention rolled in for the trip, Garza decided to run it back, this time taking Goode on a trip to see the Rams — and get a visit from his favorite player, Cooper Kupp. The relationship between Goode and Garza has been winning over the hearts of the internet.

Podcast: Can Machine Learning Solve the Challenges of Cloud Computing?
 
Ryan Marcus, PhD'19
Marcus is continuing his work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The primary reason that organizations are moving to cloud computing is elasticity: the ability to engage more servers during periods of high usage. However, the increasing complexity of clouds creates challenges associated with scaling up the architecture of existing data systems. Ryan Marcus, PhD'19, discusses how machine learning can address these issues. 

For more information on scholarships and aid, or more details on the master's programs in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics, and Mathematics, please don't hesitate to contact us.  Sincerely,  Jaclyn L. Farina Assistant Dean of Admission

Conditions of Carriage

Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example: 

• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.
• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.
• Our right to change terms of the contract.
• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.
• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.
• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight. 

Advice To Passengers On Limitations Of Liability

For international travel to or from another country, airline liability is governed by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention. There are no financial limits for death or bodily injury, and the airline may make an advance payment to cover immediate economic needs. The airline's liability for passenger delay, and for loss, delay or damage to baggage may be limited by the Conventions. In case of baggage, the liability limit is 1131 Special Drawing Rights (approximately US $1787) per passenger for international travel. The baggage limit is US $3,500 per ticketed passenger for US domestic travel. These baggage liability limitations apply unless you declare a higher valuation and pay additional charges at check-in. In case of international travel, any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of the actual or scheduled arrival of the aircraft; and, in case of baggage claims, written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in case of damage, and, in case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of the passenger. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.

Since you covered 4.1 in class on Monday, the homework for that should have been due tonight, but things got confusing for all of us, so let's make 4.1 and 4.3 homework all due on Thursday at 11:59 pm.
Reading quiz for 4.1 should have been due before Monday, but we messed that up, so both 4.1 and 4.3 reading quiz are due tonight at 11:59pm 
Sorry for the confusion.  Hopefully the extra time to finish the 4.1 HW makes life a little easier for you.

Dear Bryant,

If you are considering a master’s degree in a STEM field and are looking to work in the government after graduating, we encourage eligible students to apply for the DOD’s SMART Scholarship:

https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart?id=smart_index

Graduates of the MISM and MSISPM programs at CMU’s Heinz College are in high demand by the US government. The full tuition scholarship and stipend from the DOD provides the financial support to cover your education-related expenses and incredible professional opportunities upon graduation.

While the selection process and related policies (including the deadline) are determined by the DoD, we are proud to say that since 2008, 34 CMU students have been awarded this scholarship.

The deadline to apply for the DOD’s SMART Scholarship is December 1, 2023.

The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.  Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  Conditions of Carriage  Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:  • Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage. • Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us. • Our right to change terms of the contract. • Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage. • Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting. • Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.  These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you. You may view these conditions of carriage on delta.com, or by requesting a copy from Delta.  You have received this email because you elected to receive your Electronic Ticket receipt sent to you via email. If you would like to take advantage of other Delta email programs featuring special fares, promotions, information and flight updates, please visit: delta.com/emailprograms or delta.com/notifications  This document establishes the creation of your electronic EMD(S) in our computer systems. It does not constitute a document of carriage. Where this document is issued for transportation or services other than passenger air transportation, specific terms and conditions may apply. These terms and conditions may be provided separately or may be obtained from the issuing agent.   Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:  If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations.

I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.”
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 13 minutes.
🇺🇦
Today, we're covering the progressives criticism of Biden's approach in Ukraine — and then the backtracking. Plus, a correction, a poll to determine what we cover next, and a question about what it means to caucus with a party.
From today's advertiser: As you can imagine, I am a newsletter addict. One of my favorite new additions to my inbox is Refind, which made me thrilled when they asked to advertise in Tangle. Refind is an ultra-customizable newsletter service. You pick what topics you like, then every day, they send you five links related to those topics. It's that simple. I wish I had thought of it. You can subscribe for free here (and for every person that does, they're going to send a Refind reader to Tangle).

Correction.
I just caught an older correction that should have been updated sooner. In our lengthy primer for the 2022 midterms, we noted that Gov. Doug Ducey in Arizona had "resigned" when previewing the race to fill his seat. This was inaccurate language. Ducey is a term limited governor who was first elected in 2014, and cannot run again because he is finishing his second term this year. So he is not resigning, but stepping down after serving the maximum term allowed in office.
This is our 70th correction in Tangle's 168-week history and our first correction since October 10th. I track corrections and place them at the top of the newsletter in an effort to maximize transparency with readers.

Last week, we wrote about learning loss across the U.S. One former teacher in New York City wrote in and noted something our coverage may have overlooked:
"You’re missing a piece to the learning loss puzzle that is really obvious to educators, but not politicians," she said. "The test scores are artificially low because the kids didn’t actually try to take the tests. They had no real accountability regarding schoolwork during the pandemic, so they didn’t take these exams with fidelity... There is learning loss, but no teacher I have spoken to is as spooked by these results as the politicians and general public are. That being said— kids are truly struggling to be in school right now after their pandemic experience and there is still not enough follow through from administrators and parents. They cannot focus and are addicted to their phones that they had complete access to during remote learning. It isn’t pretty."

Today's topic.
The progressives’ letter on Ukraine. Last week, a group of 30 progressives in the House urged President Biden to shift his strategy on the Ukraine war, before quickly withdrawing their call for more diplomacy in his approach.
It started on Monday, when the group, led by Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), released a letter asking Biden to pair funding with a “proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a cease fire.” It was the first time members of Biden's own party had pushed him to change his approach to the war in Ukraine. Specifically, the group of House Democrats expressed concern that the United States is not engaged in regular dialogue with Russia as part of its effort to end a protracted war. Rather, the Biden administration has remained steadfast that it is up to leaders in Ukraine to decide when and where to negotiate with Russia.
“Let me be clear: we are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion,” Jayapal said. “Diplomacy is an important tool that can save lives — but it is just one tool.”
However, the letter caused such a wave of backlash that the group of Democrats withdrew it less than a day after its release. According to Politico, the letter was initially scheduled for release in early August, but was delayed and eventually released without the knowledge of many of the Democrats who had signed it. Rep. Jayapal contended that the letter was released improperly by a staffer without thorough vetting. Just weeks before, Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) warned that aid requests from Ukraine won't get a "blank check" if Republicans take back Congress. Jayapal said coverage of the letter conflated her caucus with GOP divisions over support for providing more aid to Ukraine (she contends that progressives are unequivocal in their support for aid).
Democrats in Congress expressed frustration about the "amateur" nature of the letter's release, and concern that it would undercut the party's unity and position on Ukraine heading into the midterms. Some conceded they signed the letter over the summer, but would not have supported its release now.
“Timing in diplomacy is everything,” California Rep. Sara Jacobs, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus that Jayapal leads, told CNN. “I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then. I wouldn’t sign it today.”
Still, the letter created a wave of commentary about Democrats’ position on the war in Ukraine, and whether progressives should be applying pressure to the party leadership. Interestingly, there are divisions on both sides of the aisle about the letter, as members of both parties have expressed growing skepticism about the path forward in Ukraine.
Today, we are going to examine some reactions to the letter from the left and right, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left is divided on the letter, with some criticizing its timing and others praising progressives for a reasonable proposal.
	•	Many Democrats worry this could signal to Putin that support for Ukraine is cracking.
	•	Some progressives argue that there was nothing wrong with the letter, and progressives should have stood by it.
In The Washington Post, Charles Lane said Putin is in Ukraine for the long haul, and we must be too.
“It was predictable that Republicans, from would-be House speaker Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) on down, would equivocate about what McCarthy called a ‘blank check’ for Ukraine. The GOP is in thrall to former president Donald Trump, who has been loudly demanding a negotiated settlement," Lane wrote. "More surprising was a letter issued Monday by 30 progressive Democrats, led by Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), which went beyond Trump’s call for the United States to broker a Russia-Ukraine deal and advocated a direct U.S.-Russia negotiation. As a rationale, it alluded to the nuclear threat and the war’s cost to taxpayers.
“Forty-two years ago, Saddam Hussein sent his army into Iran, expecting little resistance and easy territorial gains, only to see the invasion stall,” Lane wrote. “Eventually, the two sides negotiated peace — after eight years of horrific combat and 500,000 deaths. There is no moral equivalence between democratic Ukraine’s resistance to Putin and the fight by theocratic Iran against Saddam. Still, a lesson from the Iraq-Iran War is that a dictator can keep pursuing military aggression long after it is obvious he miscalculated. No one can say how long that period might be in Putin’s case, but displays of irresolution from members of Congress probably won’t help shorten it.”
In New York Magazine, Eric Levitz said the letter was "right" and "pointless."
“The [Congressional Progressive Caucus] did not counsel capitulation to Vladimir Putin’s war aims. Rather, the caucus argued that any negotiated settlement must preserve ‘a free and independent Ukraine,’ enjoy the support of the Ukrainian people, and include ‘security guarantees’ that would oblige major military powers (presumably including western ones) to defend Ukraine in the event of a future Russian invasion,” Levitz wrote. “Critically, the CPC stipulated that the White House must not coerce Ukraine into such an agreement, as ‘it is not America’s place to pressure Ukraine’s government regarding sovereign decisions.’ In other words: The United States must not threaten to withdraw military aid in order to persuade Ukraine of the merits of a peace deal but must instead maintain aid for as long as Ukraine deems appropriate.
“Yet the letter was almost universally condemned for selling out Ukraine," Levitz wrote. "On one level, the controversy the letter generated is easy to understand. The missive came one week after House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy suggested his party might try to cut off funding for Ukraine should Republicans secure congressional control in November... On another level, though, the brouhaha over the CPC’s statement is bizarre. In the document, progressives put forward a framework for peace that is roughly as hard-line as any proposed by their party’s hawks. The liberal legislators sketch a diplomatic resolution in which Ukraine remains ‘free and independent’ while enjoying the protection of security guarantees from western powers, an arrangement that would bring Ukraine under NATO’s security umbrella, in fact if not in law. The letter does not counsel any territorial concessions.”
In CNN, Stephen Collinson said Putin has been waiting for this moment, and the first cracks may be starting to appear.
“It’s clear that a bipartisan consensus for aiding Ukraine still exists in Washington. But the rumblings that Biden’s hardline on Russia may not always enjoy near unanimous support came at an especially sensitive time as the West seeks to discredit Russia’s latest round of nuclear rhetoric – a warning that Kyiv could use a dirty bomb. The claims have led to high-level talks between US and Russian military chiefs and are widely being interpreted as either more scare tactics or perhaps an attempt by Moscow to create a false flag operation that could be used as a pretext for its own use of weapons of mass destruction,” Collinson said. “This is why signs of fraying political resolve in the United States, and in some allied nations, are so significant. They could convince Putin that a war of attrition over the winter could sooner or later cause fatigue in the West and therefore weaken Ukraine’s ability to fight.
“And yet some of the questions raised by those who are cautious about the US stance are relevant and important,” Collinson wrote. “A foreign policy operation that lines up the United States against its former Cold War foe and nuclear rival must be constantly evaluated and justified by the President, given the cost and risks. The fact that there is no diplomatic track in the conflict – Biden has several times mused privately that he doesn’t know what Putin’s ‘off-ramps’ might be – is worthy of discussion and, potentially, testing in contacts with Moscow. And at a time of raging inflation and economic hardship in the United States, it is incumbent on the administration and its supporters to demonstrate to American taxpayers why a war on the edge of Europe is sucking up billions in public money, even if it’s not as if Ukraine currently has the ‘blank check’ McCarthy mentioned.”

What the right is saying. 
	•	Many on the right are divided about the letter, with some arguing that progressives got embarrassed and others saying it was a gift to Putin.
	•	Some conservatives say it’s proof of how "wrongthink" is treated when it comes to the war in Ukraine.
	•	Others say the letter was misguided, and progressives are undermining the one thing Biden has done right.
In Politico, Rich Lowry panned progressives' "humiliating retreat."
“House progressives made a terrible mistake — they used the D-word in public," he said. "The D-word in question is ‘diplomacy,’ which has long been a favored word of Democrats. Indeed, it’s their go-to proposal for solving any international problem, no matter how intractable or threatening. That it has now become a toxic notion in the context of the Ukraine war is a sign of how a justified feeling of moral righteousness among backers of Ukraine is swallowing rational thought about how the war might end... You don’t have to endorse any of the specific proposals talked about by these very different people to be disturbed by the campus-like fervor with which they have been deemed unsayable and unthinkable.
“Although it’s possible that the Russia war machine, if it can be called that, simply collapses in Ukraine, it is more likely that war will end in some messy compromise involving a negotiated settlement,” Lowry wrote. “Acknowledging this — and that the continuation of the conflict is a humanitarian catastrophe with enormous costs for the West and the world — shouldn’t be a quasi-thought crime... Still, a member of the House Democratic leadership told POLITICO Playbook that ‘Vladimir Putin would have signed that letter if asked.’ This isn’t remotely true, but it shows how departing an inch from the orthodoxy on the war is automatically taken as an admission of fondness for the Kremlin, even when Democrats are talking about other Democrats.”
The Wall Street Journal editorial board congratulated Democratic leaders for taking on the "progressive" revolt.
“Vladimir Putin watches American politics closely, and this was a sign of U.S. retreat that needed to be beaten back," the board said. “The letter had urged President Biden to pursue diplomacy with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The missive was a terrible message to send while Mr. Putin is bombing civilian targets in Ukraine even as his troops retreat from territory they occupied early in the invasion. 'The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,' Ms. Jayapal said in statement... That strikes us a too-convenient excuse, since the progressives had clearly drafted and signed a letter with an intent to release it at some point.
“The better explanation is that many senior Democrats, in Congress and the White House, were furious at this message of appeasement to Russian aggression," the board wrote. "Every war ends in diplomacy of some kind, but negotiating with Russia over the heads of the Ukrainians, who are doing the dying, is immoral and not in America’s interests. No useful diplomacy is possible as long as Ukrainians want to fight for their homeland and Mr. Putin refuses to cede territory. The quickest way to change Mr. Putin’s mind is to continue supporting Ukraine so it can keep rolling back Russian forces. A Ukrainian defeat will make Mr. Putin that much bolder, and NATO’s frontline states will be next on his target list."
In The New York Post, Dalibor Rohac said progressives have undermined "the one thing" Biden has done right: Rally support for Ukraine.
“While shrouded in verbal displays of support for the Ukrainian government and people, there is little daylight between the letter and the expressions of indifference to Ukraine’s fate coming earlier from the likes of J.D. Vance, Ohio’s Republican Senate candidate. The far left and the far right believe, wrongly, that the United States and its hard power is a force for ill in the world and that our government should focus instead [on] problems at home,” Rohac said. “The Squad would benefit from talking to actual Ukrainians first. Sure, a short war is preferable to a long one. Yet what matters far more is whether Ukrainians liberate their country and stop the enslavement of thousands of their fellow citizens in occupied territories.
“More important, their call for the administration to ‘seriously explore all possible avenues, including direct engagement with Russia,’ the signatories — who included Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — put on display their complete lack of understanding of Ukraine’s situation,” she wrote. “The reason this is not the time for some chimerical ‘negotiated settlement and ceasefire’ has nothing to do with anyone’s lack of effort but rather with the fact that the existing differences of opinion between Russia and Ukraine cannot be resolved at the negotiating table but only on the battlefield. Specifically, the Kremlin continues to believe it can successfully destroy Ukrainian statehood or, at the very least, absorb a sufficiently large part of Ukraine’s territory and population into Russia. Ukrainian leadership, in contrast, is convinced it can repel the Russian invasion altogether.”

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	I was happy to see the letter.
	•	To me, nothing inside it should have been that offensive or objectionable.
	•	It would be great if anti-war Republicans and Democrats could actually start working together, rather than avoiding each other. 
I was actually glad to see the letter.
I've written a lot about Ukraine over the last year or so, and most recently about the worthiness of imagining a "best case scenario" where Putin loses, is forced out of power in Russia, and Ukraine retakes territory it lost beginning with the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Ceding the points of many of my readers, I've begun to think it is worth at least imagining and wishing for that reality in the future — as it truly does look like the best-case scenario, and even if it isn’t the most likely outcome, it’s a possible one.
But my own political ideologies are also fundamentally anti-war. And, so long as we are continuing to operate with global reach, as a global superpower, with the strongest military on planet earth, I'd much prefer there to be a significant, outspoken, and unafraid group of congresspeople that are pushing an anti-war agenda. To me, that's how the letter read. That it puts some progressives on a similar footing as the potential GOP leader and other House Republicans is a good thing, not a bad thing. Our country has been desperately starved of a strong, bipartisan war-skeptical coalition for decades. We should all want a Congress that fears protracted war and nuclear holocaust, and operates with an abundance of caution when it comes to funding conflicts thousands of miles away from our shores.
I think it is also critical that we focus on what the letter actually said. Progressives called for direct talks with Russia, yes. They also called for bringing Ukraine under the protection of NATO, zero territorial concessions, and preserving an independent, sovereign, and democratic Ukrainian state. Which sounds to me exactly like what Volodymyr Zelensky wants.
"Such a framework [for negotiating a ceasefire] would presumably include incentives to end hostilities, including some form of sanctions relief, and bring together the international community to establish security guarantees for a free and independent Ukraine that are acceptable for all parties, particularly Ukrainians," the letter said.
The Washington Post framed such a proposal as a "dramatic shift" to Biden's strategy in Ukraine, but, as Eric Levitz noted, the U.S. Defense Secretary was speaking directly with his Russian counterpart the day before its release. And as progressives point out in the letter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself has "reiterated that the war 'will only definitively end through diplomacy,' and had previously explained that 'any mentally healthy person always chooses the diplomatic path, because he or she knows: even if it is difficult, it can prevent the loss of thousands, tens of thousands...and maybe even millions of lives.'"
Does a diplomatic end to this war with zero territorial concessions look likely right now? No. It doesn't. But it shouldn't be offensive to suggest we become proactive about seeking one out, especially when it's explicitly suggested we don't negotiate over Ukraine's head. And it certainly shouldn’t cause the kind of backlash and backtracking that it has.
Progressives were right to release the letter. Furthermore, they should stop being afraid of "looking like" certain members of the House GOP who might actually see eye-to-eye with them on the war's future. The same goes for House Republicans and the progressive caucus. McCarthy’s “blank check” comments have been framed by the press as some kind of undermining of Ukraine, but they were more just a push against unconditional support for undetermined periods of time. Progressives and House Republicans may not agree on the terms of any potential peace deal. They also might. There is clearly a lot of skepticism from both parties about a “blank check” future, what should be required to continue funding the war, and how the Biden administration may help usher in an end to it.
Unfortunately, each party's purity tests kill any hope for legitimate bipartisan agreement before the platforms are built, even when agreement is plain to see (as it was in the brief 24 hours that progressives stood by the letter's release). 
My belief is that we should continue to defend Ukraine. We should support them in their fight for independence and reclaiming the territory that has been annexed. And we should use all the diplomatic skill, leverage and experience we have to actively seek out an end to the war. This should not be controversial, it should not be cause for condemnation, and we should be thrilled to see the early form of a bipartisan coalition operating with a lot of skepticism around war.

Your questions, answered.
Q: I'd like to understand more about the possibility of Evan McMullin caucusing with the Republicans, Democrats, or neither. What does it mean to caucus with one party or the other and what are the implications of choosing neither? Would he have reduced influence, or maybe more, as a possible deciding vote? Thanks for the thorough and impartial coverage, I really appreciate your newsletter.
— Josh in Clinton, Utah
Tangle: Great question, and thanks for the kind words.
There are a few different definitions for "caucus." There are, as in Iowa, "caucuses" to determine a presidential nominee — which was often how it was done before the primary elections. In this context, though, caucusing is about the decision to partner with a political party in Congress, which is very significant. For instance, when you hear "Bernie Sanders," you probably think of a far-left Democrat. Yet Sanders is actually an independent, he just caucuses with Democrats — making him a reliable Democratic vote in the Senate.
In the U.S., caucusing with one political party or the other means you tend to negotiate and meet with that party privately. Internally, caucuses in Congress (both broadly speaking or more specifically, like the Congressional Black Caucus) operate under specific rules to advance ideas, vote on positions or on leadership, and negotiate legislation. So, if Evan McMullin were to caucus with Democrats, that means he is unlikely to be invited to private, internal meetings among Republicans. If, as he says he intends to, he were to caucus with neither party, it'd be an open-ended question as to what kind of access he'd get on either side.
For instance, a Republican Senate caucus might meet to decide which candidates it wants to back in the primaries. Or, a Democratic Senate caucus may meet to decide whether it wants to support or oppose another round of Covid-19 funding. These caucuses are opportunities for each party to wield and direct power, which means opting out of them would make McMullin a uniquely unaffiliated member.

Under the radar.
Russia said on Saturday that it is suspending its participation in a UN-brokered deal to allow Ukraine to export agricultural products like grain through the Black Sea. The deal, which was negotiated earlier this year, helped ease worries of famine and hunger spreading in parts of the world that rely on Ukraine's exports for food. But Russia says drone attacks launched against its fleet in the Black Sea are cause for abandoning the agreement. A total of 218 vessels are now "effectively blocked," Ukraine says. Some 9 million tons of agricultural cargo had been shipped through Black Sea ports since the deal took effect on August 1. The Associated Press has the story.

Numbers.
	•	$17.9 billion. The amount of military funding the United States has provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war.
	•	66%. The percentage of Americans who support the U.S. providing weapons to Ukraine, according to an early October poll.
	•	34%. The percentage of Americans who said the U.S. should send troops to Ukraine to help it defeat Russia, according to the same poll.
	•	6%. The fall in number of legal abortions in the first two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
	•	95%. In states that have banned or severely restricted abortion, the decrease in legal abortions in those two months.
	•	11%. In states where abortion remained legal, the increase in the number of abortions.

Have a nice day. 
A restaurant owner in Kirkland, Washington, noticed that there was a lack of fish in the stream outside of her business. Holly Smith is the owner of Cafe Juanita, named after Juanita Creek, which runs alongside the restaurant. In 22 years, she said she had seen one fish in the creek. So she decided to partner with King Conservation District and Adopt-a-Stream to help restore the creek by pulling out invasive plants and adding wood retaining walls along some of the shoreline. The day after the two nonprofits finished their work, Smith says, she came outside and saw 15-20 fish swimming in the creek. It was so astonishing she thought someone had stocked it overnight with salmon, but it was really just the immediate result of their work. K5 News has the story.

Harbor 8th Ward 
Hello Brothers and Sisters,

Tithing Declaration represents a special opportunity to meet with the Bishop as a family unit once per year to declare tithing status, to learn about the blessings of tithing, and to spend time with our wonderful Bishop. This year is particularly exciting because this will be a great opportunity to get to know our new Bishop. 
Appointments for Tithing Declaration are set to begin on November 1st and will continue through the end of the year. We will be utilizing a virtual sign-up service called Calendly. The use of Calendly will facilitate a more streamlined process for making appointments. Please use the link below to sign up for an available time on Bishop's calendar:
https://calendly.com/harbor8th/tithing-declaration-2022
Please remember that appointments should occur in family units except in extenuating circumstances. This will allow for the bishop to have greater availability to meet with more of you before the rush of the holiday season is upon us. 
We love you brothers and sisters and are excited for tithing declaration. 
Please let me know if you have any trouble with the link or if you need any help scheduling an appointment. 
v/r,

I'm pleased that Amelia Henriksen, a scientist at Sandia National Laboratory and an ACME alumna, will be visiting BYU tomorrow (Thursday).  She has generously agreed to meet with ACME students to share her experiences, answer your questions, and give some useful advice. 
This is a great opportunity to learn about an interesting career path for ACME students and learn about some cool applications of the sorts of things you are learning.  
Her schedule is as follows:
	•	 10 AM, research presentation in 301 TMCB (See abstract below)
	•	11 am, meeting with ACME women in 307 TMCB
	•	12 noon, meeting with all ACME students in 244 TMCB (the ACME Junior study room) 
Unfortunately every largish room in the TMCB is booked at noon, which is why we'll be using the Junior study room.  
Research Talk: “The Impact of Concept Drift on Anomaly Detection for Maritime Trajectory Analytics”
 Abstract: Anomalies in national security operations are often high risk, and need to be detected quickly from real world, incoming data-sources. Hence it is critical that we develop unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that both operate on a stream and adapt to it. Real world data streams involve multiple, intersecting forms of concept drift, meaning that the underlying data distribution changes over time. In this talk, we present our work developing generalizable techniques for adapting existing unsupervised anomaly detection pipelines to handle multiple types of concept drift simultaneously. This presentation is driven by an exciting application space relevant to both national security and the environment: anomaly detection for maritime trajectory analytics.

Challenge: learn the name and one meaningful thing about every member of the senior core.  You can see everyone's names on LearningSuite.  As a preliminary check of your success on this, each class period a few of your classmates miss class for health or other reasons—can you figure out who?
Exam: I know that the upcoming exam feels intimidating, and the study guide didn't really help lessen that feeling.  I am sorry about that.  But I hope you all know that our goal in giving the exam is not to grade you or sort you, but rather to help you learn better.  It's like giving an actual public concert after two months of rehearsals.  Or maybe it's like competing in an actual track meet after two months of workouts.   It's stressful, but it motivates and helps you grow and learn in ways that you could not do any other way. 
One suggestion I'll add to the study guide is that even though the test covers three long chapters, there's a lot of duplication across chapters, with subsequent material reviewing and building on previous material, and there's a lot fo relations among the different ideas.  For example, we covered various aspects of Bayesian statistics in all three chapters.  Instead of treating those as separate sections with separate ideas, think about how all of them work together to give a full picture of one main idea.   And even the big repeated ideas are related, for example Bayesian updating is a special case of the general principle of incorporating new information by minimizing relative entropy.
Office hours: because of a conflict tomorrow, my normal Thursday-morning office hours are moved to Wednesday (today) at 4pm.  
If you are feeling stressed about the exam, or life, or whatever, come see me.  If office hours are too busy or not private enough, send me an email and we'll set up a time just for you.

Hi all,
Our previous newsletter sent at 11:57 a.m. appears to have a copy and paste error that had "My take" under the wrong section. To correct the error, we're taking the unusual step of resending the newsletter. You can find the corrected edition below.
Thank you,

Today's read: 12 minutes.
📓
Today, we're covering the results from the "Nation's Report Card," which showed significant drops in learning for fourth and eighth graders — tied to the pandemic — in both math and reading. We also have a major milestone and a reader question about Steve Bannon's sentence.
From today's advertiser: When I started Tangle, our goal was to create a platform where open-minded debate could thrive. Not long ago, Yascha Mounk set out on a similar journey when he created Persuasion, a (free!) nonprofit newsletter that tries to persuade you of one stance in every edition. Three times a week, you'll get short opinion pieces from some of today's leading thinkers.
If you're looking for a newsletter to expand your thinking and challenge your biases, give the free Persuasion newsletter a try (and tell them we sent you).

50,000 subscribers!
Yesterday, Tangle broke 50,000 subscribers for the first time ever. This is a huge milestone for us, and one I felt the need to acknowledge today. I still vididly remember sending our first newsletter out to 50 friends and family members three years ago.
It is hard to describe how rewarding it is to see so many people who believe in a news outlet that values diversity of opinion, debate, nuance, and fairness. It gives me renewed faith in the intellect and humility not just of Americans, but of folks across the world reading Tangle. Thank you.
While I have you: Now is a great time to spread the word about what we're doing. You can share Tangle via email by clicking here or on Twitter by clicking here.

Today's topic. 
Test scores. On Monday, the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) released "The Nation's Report Card," an annual assessment of reading and math scores for American fourth and eighth grade students. The results were discouraging: Math scores for fourth and eighth graders on the nationally representative tests showed the largest declines since NAEP testing began in 1990. Reading scores also declined in both grades.
While federal officials often caution against tying student performance to any outlying factors, this time was unique. Peggy Carr, the National Center for Education Statistics Commissioner, attributed the "troubling" declines to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on student achievement.
From USA Today:
In 2022, average reading scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by three points from 2019, and average math scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by five and eight points respectively, the test results show. The test, which involved 446,700 students at 10,970 schools, across all states at the beginning of the calendar year, is scored on a scale of 0 to 500. The 2022 results also show … the lowest-performing students performed even worse. And of particular concern, more students scored at what are considered "below basic" levels.
Typically, the NAEP thinks of a 1 or 2 point decline as a significant impact on student achievement. 10-point declines are roughly equivalent to losing a full year of learning. On this assessment, there was an 8-point decline in math. Nearly four in 10 eighth graders failed to grasp basic math concepts, while reading scores hit their lowest levels since 1992.
According to Carr, students’ scores didn't directly correlate to how long schools were closed or whether in-person classes were happening. That's in part because, when schools finally did open, many teachers or students ended up missing class due to Covid-19 outbreaks.
“Let me be very clear: These results are not acceptable,” Miguel Cardona, the new education secretary under President Biden, said. “We need to continue to approach the task of catching all of our students up with the urgency that this issue warrants. We must redouble our efforts to accelerate student recovery."
The results of the assessment are another indicator of the pandemic's destructive impact on learning. Students in the high school class of 2022 also achieved the lowest average score on the ACT test in over three decades. However, ACT scores had already been declining steadily for five years. The average test score in 2022 was 19.8 out of 36. In 2021, it was 20.3; in 2020, it was 20.6; and in 2019, it was 20.7.
The latest report from the NAEP drove a range of new commentary about how we navigated the pandemic and our children's learning. Today, we'll take a look at some opinions from the right and left, then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left worries about the already underserved students who are falling even farther behind.
	•	Some emphasize that losses occurred across the country, regardless of how Covid-19 was handled.
	•	Others say we need to smartly use allocated federal funds to close the gap.
The Los Angeles Times editorial board said "it's no surprise" that educational achievement suffered everywhere.
"But it’s still distressing to see the desolate picture of students’ academics and ever-widening gap between low- and high-performing students revealed by the latest national proficiency test scores," the editorial board said. "California students fared slightly better than students in most other states, with small declines in math but less significant changes in reading. However, California students are still underperforming compared with national standards. Most troublingly, low-performing students’ scores declined at much higher rates than higher-performing students. For example, the average score in 2022 for students at Los Angeles Unified schools who are eligible for the free lunch program was 35 points lower than students who didn’t qualify for that program. In 2002, that difference was only 14 points.
"It’s clear that a multi-pronged approach to boosting student performance will be necessary, but state and local educators and policymakers should ensure that decisions about how to allocate resources are driven by data and other evidence. California schools received $15 billion from the American Rescue Plan," they wrote. "The state created the $4.6-billion Expanded Learning Opportunity Grant in 2021, issuing a set of guidelines for districts to spend on designated support such as additional staff, but it’s up to districts to come up with plans that meet their needs... Now that educators have the funds and the data to help guide them, they should use that money wisely. Our children’s future depends on it."
In The Washington Post, Eugene Robinson argued that it wasn't just blue states who suffered serious learning loss.
"It turns out that all the bitter back-and-forth between red and blue states about how quickly to reopen schools during the covid-19 pandemic was nothing but political theater, as far as test scores are concerned," Robinson said. "Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, for example, made a big show of reopening their states’ schools in the fall of 2020, with DeSantis going so far as to threaten to withhold funding from school districts that did not comply. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, on the other hand, moved more slowly, conditioning the return to in-person instruction on the level of covid-19 infection in a given county. But the NAEP report, based on testing this spring, showed that student performance suffered equally despite the different approaches.
"Math scores for fourth-graders dropped by four points in California, five points in Florida and five points in Texas," Robinson said. "For eighth-graders, scores dropped by six points in California, seven points in Florida and seven points in Texas. Scores in reading in those three states also moved in lockstep, falling by a point or two. Political posturing might have mattered to governors who’d like to be president someday, but it made no difference to the millions of children in the nation’s schools. From the students’ point of view, there was no 'right way' to blunt the impact of the pandemic. All strategies, we now know, were equally futile."
In The Hill, Javaid Siddiqi said we're failing our most vulnerable students.
"While reviewing the report, some statistics jumped out at me: that Black students experienced a mathematics score drop seven points higher than their white peers; that, despite showing steady gains for the last 20 years prior to the pandemic, Black and Hispanic students’ scores have regressed to where they were in 1999; that students who were already struggling before the pandemic showed the most dramatic declines," Siddiqi said. "These results, while concerning, are not surprising. They mirror other recent studies that have found that schools attended by predominantly Black and Hispanic students — which we know tend to have less funding and resources even in the best of times — were more negatively impacted than predominately white schools.
"In addition to addressing the immediacy of this pandemic-related learning loss, we must also consider long-term strategies to ensure our systems are built to effectively support all students," Siddiqi wrote. "Research has shown unequivocally that educators of color increase the performance of all students, particularly students of color. Similarly, having school leaders of color creates pathways that lead to better outcomes for students of color as well. In fact, we know that having a diverse educator workforce is a benefit to all students and communities... While these results are alarming, and we should be prepared for more of the same when state-level NAEP results are released in November, all is not lost. We have strategies that can close these gaps — as well as time-sensitive federal relief funding to adopt these approaches."

What the right is saying.
	•	The right says we failed our children with poor policy decisions, and blames many Democratic politicians.
	•	Some emphasize the differences in scores between public and private schools.
	•	Others say the data shows how disastrous remote learning really was.
National Review's editors said we "failed the children of the pandemic."
"The declines were not evenly distributed nationwide," the editors wrote. "New York City, which had longer periods of Zoom school and imposed masks on children until very recently, experienced a record drop in math scores. Washington, D.C., and Maryland saw double-digit declines in fourth- and eighth-grade math. Meanwhile, Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis, an early opponent of school closures, is spiking the football. Florida achieved its highest-ever rankings in fourth- and eighth-grade math and reading. The federal government spent $123 billion last year on public schools in an effort to help children catch up from Covid-era learning loss. These test results show the effort failed.
"Democrat-led areas had longer school closures," they said. "The reckoning for this failure has to be system-wide. The CDC allowed its own recommendations on in-person education to be shaped by lobbyists from the American Federation of Teachers. Experts, acting in concert with Democratic state officials, were so anxious to flatter teachers as an extension of the white-collar Zoom class that they have surrendered their reputation as defenders of public education to Republicans such as DeSantis, Georgia’s Brian Kemp, and Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin. Parents are already making their own choices. In 2022, 2 million fewer students enrolled in public schools in America. A decades-long decline in parochial-school enrollment has been reversed. Private schools that stayed open and provided parents with free choices about masks and vaccines are thriving."
The Washington Examiner said the test scores illustrate the "disaster of distance learning."
"Chalk this up once again to Democrats' obsession with rewarding political allies at the expense of the public," the Examiner said. "Although there are surely other culprits — in Virginia, for example, Democratic appointees watered down educational standards starting in 2015, followed by precipitous declines in proficiency — the obvious culprit for most of the national decline is distance learning during COVID. And there's no question that the closures contributed significantly to the decline in learning. There are two proofs of this. First, Catholic schools almost everywhere were open full time by the fall of 2020, and on aggregate, the data show that they avoided the worst of the learning loss, avoiding declines in proficiency in fourth grade math and eighth grade reading.
"Moreover, states that kept more schools open experienced smaller declines in proficiency than their peers — a statistically significant result that this chart illustrates graphically," they said. "Once it was clear that COVID was not a major threat to children, that they were neither likely to suffer severe symptoms nor to pass the disease to others, every schoolhouse in America should have reopened immediately for in-person instruction... Unfortunately, special interests run many state educational bureaucracies, and of course, special interests positively own the Biden administration. Government emails obtained by journalists damningly demonstrate that President Joe Biden's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even reversed its scientific judgments about school closures based on pressure from the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union."
In Deseret News, Bethany Mandel said it is bad policy from the privileged, not Covid-19, that hurt students.
"How did those at the head of federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in addition to those working in education policy nationally and on a state level (not to mention their media defenders), get our COVID-19 response so wrong? The answer can be explained in one word: privilege," Mandel wrote. "Many students were in single-parent homes without robust support systems. There was no mom or dad sitting at the dining-room table trying to help them log onto Zoom or work through a math worksheet; many of these parents were essential workers out delivering packages and food to those who had the privilege of working from home.
"When these kids had problems, there was no one around to help them, so they just didn’t log in," she wrote. "Of course these kids have fallen even farther behind. It wasn’t that Zoom learning (an already inadequate solution) wasn’t happening in these homes; there was no learning at all taking place. Those in positions of power and privilege who set education policy were completely disconnected from this existence. If they even had school-aged children, they were using their privilege to make sure their children didn’t fall behind by sending them to private schools, hiring tutors or doing the tutoring themselves. They simply couldn’t fathom that there were parents who could not do the same."

My take.

It's a really difficult report to see.
Throughout the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the long-term impact of remote learning and school closures. And as worried as some of the most ardent critics were, I think these test scores actually paint a more troubling picture than many imagined. A math decline equivalent to nearly an entire year of learning will put tens of millions of K-12 students behind for the rest of their time in school. Some, of course, will catch up. But it will take several years, if not more, to do that.
Hindsight, of course, is 20/20. I wrote regularly about my belief that students should have gone back to school sooner — and that, by summer of 2021, even masking them was a questionable policy. In July of 2021, I wrote this:
The highest-end estimate for Covid-19 deaths among children is about 500, though the official tally is 335. The CDC estimates that 600 kids died of the flu during the 2017-2018 season. But recent studies, including the latest in England, indicate that — unlike deaths in adults — we could be overcounting Covid-19 deaths in children. 99.995% of the 469,982 kids in England who got Covid-19 survived. Of the 61 deaths linked to a positive Covid-19 test, the study found only 25 were actually caused by the illness. Furthermore, of those 25 children, 15 had underlying serious illnesses. Study after study has shown kids’ risk of serious Covid-19 illness is extremely low.
The tricky part about keeping schools open was never really about the kids, though. Even if students have been mostly safe from serious Covid-19, teachers, administrators, janitors and other staff weren't. And, of course, a lot of kids live in homes with elderly or otherwise high-risk family members, making the risks of them bringing the virus home very high.
Still, the learning loss is a stark reminder that nearly all policy upsides come with downsides, too. In a crude manner, policymakers had to weigh how many potential deaths or serious illnesses among family and staff were worth a certain level of learning loss for students. Anyone who confidently opines on where that line is should check their ego. I certainly don't envy the position policymakers and administrators were put in.
If we could go back and have a redo, though, there are plenty of things I think we could have done differently. The most obvious is that we should have emphasized in-person learning and put most of our Covid-19 testing resources into getting kids back into schools. Rather than default to distance learning and set bars for returning to the classroom, a more holistic policy may have been defaulting to in-person learning and using testing to decide when to send kids home. The strain distance learning put not just on students, but on low-income parents who relied on school for childcare and lunches, is hard to overstate.
Other things that were obvious then have been borne out now: Higher-performing students were more likely to have a computer or tablet at home, high-speed internet, and a quiet room to participate in class from. In a Covid-19 re-do, federal and state funding could have prioritized either closing those gaps, or simply keeping kids in school for in-person learning who didn't have the space and resources to reasonably participate in classes at home.
Again, none of this is simple, but the results — a wave of learning loss on top of two years of parents being strained by childcare — were obvious to parents and critics of remote learning at the time.

Your questions, answered. 
Q: Steve Bannon just got slapped on the wrist by a judge, but I was surprised that the judgment didn't include forcing him to submit to the Congressional subpoena. Why not?
— John, Oberlin, Ohio
Tangle: Well, in simple terms, you can't force anyone to testify. The "forcing" is the punishment Bannon got: the threat of jail time and a fine. If he is willing to serve jail time and pay the fine, he's served the punishment for refusing to comply with the subpoena, and that is basically as far as the court can go.
For what it's worth, I think part of Bannon's case was a bit more complicated than it was often made out to be. Obviously, he was in contempt of Congress, and refused to comply with the subpoena. And as I've said before I think his defense (that all his conversations with the president were privileged) is rather farcical. But Bannon did hire a legal team, engage the committee in dialogue, and say he’d be willing to testify if the issue about the privileged conversations were resolved. His lawyers also benefited from a huge mistake by the government prosecutors, who, while trying to retrieve emails and phone logs of Bannon's lawyer Robert Costello, accidentally filed the records of a different man by the same name.
It's also worth noting that the Jan. 6 committee opted against a civil lawsuit to enforce its subpoena, and that Bannon — as the judge put it — seemed to be relying on his lawyer's advice, rather than acting on his own in defiance of the committee.
For now, though, Bannon is free pending appeal, and has suffered few consequences for his actions except a $6,500 fine. I would love to see him testify, and agree that (unless he serves actual time) it is a slap on the wrist. But if he is willing to eat the punishment there is really no other plausible legal recourse.

Under the radar. 
The number of disabled people in the workforce has surged, according to new research by the New York Fed. Likely because of long Covid, some 900,000 disabled people have entered the workforce since 2020. Right now, with a hot labor market, employers are more likely to accommodate their needs. But some people worry that as the economy cools, those employers may become less accommodating. There were 1.05 million more disabled working-age Americans in August 2022 compared to January 2020, according to the data, which was compiled by economist Richard Deitz. Axios has the story.

Numbers.
	•	70%. The percentage of kids in the NAEP survey who said they had learned remotely during the last part of the previous year.
	•	41. The number of states where math scores for fourth graders declined.
	•	10,000. The number of schools sampled in the survey. 
	•	$123 billion. The overall investment the federal government made in schools last year.
	•	$2,400. The cost, per student, of that investment. 
	•	20%. The amount of that funding districts are required to spend on academic recovery. 

Have a nice day.   
An injured hiker in Colorado was rescued after a train passenger spotted her from his window. The hiker, a woman from New Mexico in her 20s, had been missing for two days after taking a fall down a cliff face. The rider alerted the crew of the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge diesel engine and then notified the train inspector, in a motor car behind them. The inspector, Delton Henry, was able to stop and communicate with the woman. She had spent the last two days trying to flag down trains before being noticed. A CareFlight helicopter evacuated the woman and she is now recovering in the hospital. NPR has the story.

If we have spent time talking about it in class, you will probably see it on the exam. Again, the major points can be found in the Study Guides and the Power Points. If something does not sound familiar to you, look it up in your scriptures and find what information you can. Don't leave answers blank. 
There are quite a few date questions, so have a general idea of when things are happening. I am not hiding anything from you and I am telling you how to prepare for the exam.
Although there are only 29 questions on the whole exam, 7 of them are essay. I want to give you a chance to write and explain your answers. Plan ahead and give yourself the full two hours to take the exam. Give yourself time so you don't feel rushed.  
Use your scriptures to look things up. I really hope that this will be a learning and uplifting experience as you take the exam. Use it as an opportunity to ponder and grow as you answers questions about what you are learning. 
Good luck. Have a great week and weekend. 
Professor Schade

Exam 2 opens Wed Oct. 26, closes Monday, October 31st 11:59 pm. Covers Amos through Isaiah (we will roll over Micah and Joel to the final exam). 
I have uploaded Power Points under Content in LS to give you some additional study aides if you want them. 
We will not hold class on Thursday so as to free up more time for you to prepare for the exam. 
On the exam, you may use your scriptures, but no other aides are permitted (including internet sources, class lectures, notes, etc.). 
There is a 2 hour time limit on the exam. With open scripture, be aware of the time. You will not be able to look everything up before the clock winds down. Once you start, the clock is running and you cannot restart it. The exam will shut off after 2 hours and at 11:59 pm on Oct 31. 
Please do the exam alone and with no one else. 
Please do not share or disseminate the exam in any format. 
Remember to upload your Study Guide as part of the exam. 
Thanks, and Good luck.

Snapshot of the item below:
Personal Revelation

Hi! I am Geralee McArthur, and we moved into the neighborhood almost 3 years ago. We love it here and have loved getting to know such good people, and the new ward has given us the opportunity to get to know even more great families. I am currently in Young Women’s and Ron is teaching Sunday School. We have 5 amazing children and 4 awesome bonus children, and have 4 beautiful grandchildren with one more coming soon. We enjoy helping them in any way we can and spending time with them. 

I’ve been asked to speak today on Personal Revelation. A line in the Young 
Women’s theme that we recite each time we meet states in part, “As a disciple of Jesus Christ, I strive to become like Him, I seek and act upon personal revelation and minister to others in His holy name.” Elder Renlund’s talk this past General Conference was a good reminder to all of us how we can receive personal revelation within the framework that the Lord has given to us. The Lord hasn’t just sent us down here to earth to learn by ourselves thru trial and error how to return back to him. I am very grateful to the Lord for giving us guidelines, in which personal revelation can take place, to guide our lives, if we are humble and willing enough to seek it.

After baptism, we are given a very heavenly yet practical gift, it is the third member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost. He is the key that unlocks the treasures of personal revelation. As we are seeking to stay on the Covenant Path, which is really just pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and all men, feasting upon the word of Christ and enduring to the end, then we shall have eternal life. The Holy Ghost becomes our personal GPS and traveling companion throughout our journey of life. He can always be with us, and will show us truthfully ALL things that we should do. He cannot and will not lie, sugar coat or rationalize away wrong choices, or go where it’s not holy. We should always be praying for the companionship of the Holy Ghost so we can come off conqueror and defeat Satan’s constant fiery darts.  

The Savior, who works with the Holy Ghost and Heavenly Father as a perfect trio, has said, “Ask, and it shall be given you;...for everyone that asketh receiveth”. The goal, with the help of the Holy Ghost is to transform our divine nature, being literal spirit children of God, into our eternal destiny, living the life that God lives in the Celestial Kingdom, to go no more out. 

The Holy Ghost can and would love to work tirelessly with us to provide personal revelation, specifically tailored, just for us. But the Holy Ghost has to stay in his lane, not just weave around wherever we think we’d like to steer our lives. He can unleash astonishing insight, direction and comfort, but we can still crash and burn if we go outside of the rules he keeps, no matter how brilliant, talented or unknowingly deceived we become. 

Just like a picture frame has 4 sides, working together, and mutually overlapping, so does personal revelation. The first side of our frame is the scriptures. Feasting on the words of Christ in the scriptures stimulates personal revelation.  Elder Robert D. Hales said, “When we want to speak to God, we pray, and when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures.” The scriptures also teach us to ask for what is right and good, and not what is contrary to God’s will. We ask Heavenly Father for what we need in the name of Jesus Christ, believing that we will receive. I love the scripture in D&C 41:1 that says the Lord “delights” to bless His people, it’s probably one of His favorite things even, if we don’t abuse His neverending kindness. Jesus also said, “If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask him?” So search the scriptures, learn to love them, find ways to apply them liberally to your life, keep them open around the house, don’t let a day pass without studying them. I have a little scripture a day calendar in my kitchen, that helps me even on the busiest days read even 1 verse. I also have put this quote by President Nelson to the test, and I can promise you it is true, He said, “as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon everyday, you will make better decisions everyday. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day, even the gripping plague of pornography and other mind-numbing addictions”.

The second side of the frame is that we will only receive revelation within our own boundaries. The living Prophet is the only one to receive revelation for the entire world and Church, for its doctrine and commandments from Jesus Christ. We cannot receive revelation for others not under our jurisdiction, just like Bishop Crook can’t receive revelation for other wards, and I can’t receive revelation for other people’s marriages or families. Thank goodness!! That would become so messy, and it is contrary to the economy of God. Everyone would be telling each other that they received a revelation or prompting for them. That is not how the Lord works, He is a God of order.  He gave us our own agency that even he won’t take away, it is that precious and hard fought. I have known people with good intentions who have told a family very strongly why they should or should not marry a specific person, go to a particular school, major in a certain subject, eat a certain food, the list could go on forever. But, we can listen to others’ opinions, appreciate their concern for us, weigh things out in our own minds, and then take it to the Lord in prayer and find out for ourselves what route we should take regarding an issue we’re needing help with. The Lord will not fail us. 

Elder Scott also said, “What do you do when you have prepared carefully, have prayed fervently, waited a reasonable time for a response, and still do not feel an answer? You may want to express thanks when that occurs, for it is evidence of His trust. When you are living worthily and your choice is consistent with the Savior’s teachings and you need to act, proceed with trust…When you are living righteously and are acting with trust, God will not let you proceed too far without a warning impression if you have made the wrong decision”. 

A third side of our framework of personal revelation is that it will be in harmony with the commandments of God and the covenants we have made with Him. Elder Renlund said in his talk, “Consider a prayer that goes something like this: Heavenly Father, Church services are boring. May I worship Thee on the Sabbath in the mountains or on the beach? May I be excused from going to church and partaking of the sacrament but still have the promised blessings of keeping the Sabbath day holy? In response to such a prayer, we can anticipate God’s response: ‘My child, I have already revealed my will regarding the Sabbath day.’” The same goes for tithe paying, keeping the Word of Wisdom, living a chaste life and other already revealed commandments.

When we try to reinvent or justify personal revelation for our lives that is contrary to what the Lord has already revealed thru the scriptures and living prophets, we are really just opening ourselves up to be deceived, led down strange paths, setting ourselves up as a light. We will get caught up in the weeds blown around with every wind of doctrine, not ever feeling the joy of a purposeful life that God wants us to have or we inwardly yearn for. We also will misinterpret our feelings and hear only what we want to hear, because to our natural man, it feels comfortable, safe or easy. It is only through real personal revelation, based on true principles, that we can feel peace. 

The prophet Joseph Smith said, “Nothing is a greater injury to the children of men than to be under the influence of a false spirit, when they think they have the Spirit of God.” It is like stubbornly leaning a ladder against a wall and after climbing to the top, finding you put it against the wrong wall afterall. So sad, but yes, we all do this from time to time, and that’s what repentance is for, thankfully. 

For the past 8 months or so, I have stayed off of social media. It came as a prompting I received after pondering what president Nelson had said about social media, and it has really been a blessing to me and my life. I don’t know how long I’ll do this, but for now, it has helped me “Hear Him”, and I am so glad I have. If there’s anything I really need to know, I have asked a few family members or friends to fill me in. They have, and my life feels so peaceful. I have plenty of time to exercise, read good books, help our family, go to the temple, do my callings and study Come Follow Me. I feel happy, blessed and more productive. 

President Nelson said at a youth devotional, “I acknowledge that there are positives about social media. But if you are paying more attention to feeds from social media than you are to the whisperings of the Spirit, then you are putting yourself at spiritual risk, as well as the risk of experiencing intense loneliness and depression.” He also warned of the “false reality” often portrayed online, where every post includes a person’s most fun, adventurous, and exciting pictures, which creates the erroneous impression that everyone else has a fun, adventurous, and exciting life. He said, “Much of what appears in your various social media feeds is distorted, if not fake. So, give yourself a 7 day break from the fake.” I did, and loved it so much, I just kept going. Even more recently, he said, “If most of the information you get comes from social or other media, your ability to hear the whisperings of the Spirit will be diminished.” Wow. I thank thee, oh God for a prophet, today and everyday. It’s not as if smartphones and social media are all evil, it’s just that they should be harnessed and bridaled, and used as a tool to help us, not hinder us. Only we can know how to best make that happen, with the help of the Spirit. The new For the Strength of Youth guidelines are much less prescriptive than in the past, and give us the freedom to seek with the help of the Spirit live and make decisions for ourselves.

The last side of the frame that keeps our lives all together through personal revelation is to recognize what God has already revealed to you personally, while being open to further revelation from Him. If God has already answered a question and the circumstances have not changed, why then would we expect the answer to be different? Stick with the program, stay on the path, endure to the end. President Hinckley so optimistically and often said, “It isn’t as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don’t worry. I say that to myself every morning. It all works out in the end. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us. If we put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers.” 

We don’t need to go and peek in the great and spacious building’s windows, rehashing what we already know to be true, and weigh it out against the loud, angry voices that are there. The Spirit speaks softly, doesn’t confuse us, follows these 4 frameworks, and gives us peace in an unstable and unsure world. The ancient peoples of Jerusalem would often seek for things they couldn’t understand, look beyond the mark, and completely overlook the Savior of the world. They stumbled because they asked for things they would not and could not understand. They also sought to counsel the Lord, and not take counsel from His omnipotent hand. It sounds so reckless and foolish, but all of us can find our own follies in the scriptures if we honestly liken them to ourselves. Human nature has not changed over the years just because we wear different clothes and speak a different language. We love to think how advanced and amazing we have become, but we would all do well to remember Moses’ words he said after having the glorious vision he had of the vastness of the Lord’s creations, “Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.” Truth bomb right there. Our intelligence is nothing compared to God’s, but we are His most precious children, whose work and glory is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life with Him. Now that is humbling, we being less than the dust of the earth, but worth all the time and talent the God of the Universe has, even sending His first born Son to suffer, die, plead, and forgive us as oft as we come to Him. He will never forsake or forget us. I know that to be true. There is no shame in daily repentance, Satan loves to grind us down and make us miserable like himself. 

Being open to further personal revelation is essential. Few of our life’s questions or concerns are answered immediately, without a lot of search and struggle and patience. It is line upon line that we live our lives, here a little and there a little, until the sun starts to slowly appear over the horizon. It’s the way it is and the way it always will be. Few of us get where we need to go on a first class, non-stop flight or a fun and breezy road trip. Even Christ Himself grew in wisdom, grace to grace until He received a fulness of the glory of the Father.

I hope we can look to these 4 frameworks to have our own personal revelations, thru scripture study, following the living prophets, staying within our own boundaries and agency, and not trying to reinvent the wheel or look for different ways to get to our prized destination when there isn’t one. The Holy One of Israel is the gatekeeper there, and He employees no servant there. We will all have to learn this one way or another, the easy way or the hard way. I know that the Holy Ghost can and will show you all things that you should do. Don’t despair, have patience, it will all work out, and we know who will ultimately win. This is the greatest cause on earth, and we can and all should be part of it. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Harbor 8th Ward 
Welcome to the newly formed Harbor 8th Ward!

Brothers and Sisters, we are so excited to start a new ward family together! A couple of things to be aware of in the coming weeks:

	1.	Ward Boundaries, Calendar Items, Sacrament Bulletin, etc. can all be found on our ward website: https://harbor8th.com  
	2.	The 23rd is our first Sunday together! We invite all young men to come 20 minutes early to prepare the sacrament and receive training on passing and blessing the sacrament. 
	3.	Sunday meetings will be at 1:30pm in the Stake Center (Lakeside Building) 239 East 1100 South, American Fork 
	4.	Bishop Satchwell’s office is in the southwest corner. Rumor has it he will have candy for any kids (and adults) that want to come say hello after church. 
	5.	Second hour for the next 2 weeks will be everyone combined in the cultural hall (nursery and primary kids included). We will be having short spiritual thoughts both weeks, and meeting the members of the ward. Refreshments will be making an appearance on the 5th Sunday. 
	6.	Youth night (YM/YW/Activity days) will be on Thursday evenings. Activity days generally meet every other week. We’ll keep you posted on that as we get primary callings in place. 

Some Calendar items:

	•	Oct 23 - 1:30pm - Our First Sunday Together! 
	•	Oct 27 - 7:00pm - YM/YW Combined Activity (get to know you games\treats) 
	•	Oct 30 - 1:30pm - 5th Sunday - refreshments in 2nd hour 
	•	Nov 4 - 6:00pm - Tentative Chili Cookoff 
	•	Dec 3 - 6:00pm - Tentative Christmas Party 

Final Thoughts:

We are so excited to begin fresh and get to know so many new faces. These changes can be hard as we are separated from old (and new) friends. Boundary changes provide opportunities to grow, learn from new people, and serve the Lord and each other in new ways. We testify that the Lord’s hand is in this work. The truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is unchanged. He lives! He loves and cares for each of us. He has joy in our successes, and sorrow in our difficulties. Seek Him. We are excited to get to know each of you. We love you, we pray for you, we look forward to serving you.

Hey y'all, I will also need to change my office hours.
Monday, Oct 24, I will be traveling during my office hours. I will not be able to make up an hour in person, but I will do my best to be on slack and on zoom from 1-3 pm that day.
Wednesday, Nov 2, I will again be traveling so I will push my office hours to zoom and change them to 4 pm (unless that presents too many conflicts for y'all, just let me know).
Friday, Nov 4, I have to cancel fully those office hours. I can possibly offer some help over slack but no guarantees that weekend. 
Friday, Nov 11, I will host these office hours on Thursday at the same time (2-3 pm) instead of on Friday.
After that weekend I will be back on track and won't have any more disruptions. I apologize for so many changes. During this time I will also try my hardest to keep grading on time. If you need a better explanation or better feedback on a specific problem feel free to reach out.
Thanks y'all!!

I am speaking at a conference tomorrow (Saturday) that runs all day and conflicts with my Zoom office hour, which means I will have to cancel it.  I apologize for this.  If you need to talk to me, send me an email and I'll make time for you somehow.
Also, my Thursday office hour has a conflict again so I will reschedule that to Wednesday at 4pm.

Dear graduate and undergraduate students:
 
I have been asked to send this information to you.
 
**********************
Hello,
 
I am teaching a course on elementary particle physics in winter 2023 listed as Phys 513R section 2. The course develops the Standard Model of particle physics using the language of Lagrangian dynamics. As such, it involves applications of the calculus of variations and the representations of Lie groups and Algebras. 
 
We also spend some time connecting these abstract models to experimental results at particle colliders. We use the industry standard software to simulate particle collisions and undertake some basic analysis of the resulting data in order to "discover" several particles. 
 
The course is largely self-contained, but some basic familiarity with the concepts of quantum mechanics is helpful. 
 
Please contact me (verhaaren@physics.byu.edu) if you have any questions,
 
-Chris Verhaaren
Assistant Professor
Department of Physics and Astronomy
N247 Eyring Science Center

Dr. Barker,
 
I am a senior in the ACME cohort with an emphasis in Linguistics. I took CS 401R Machine Translation as a class for my concentration last year, and Dr. Richardson has encouraged me to take CS 601R Machine Translation next semester. I have spoken to Dr. Jarvis and he seems to be supportive of allowing CS 601R to be used for the linguistic concentration.

Hello!

Just as a reminder, we need help setting up for the HS banquet tonight. We will be setting up about 50 tables and will need lots of hands. Please meet in the Wilkinson ballroom today at 5:30pm. There will be Two Jacks pizza for all those that help set up.

Thanks again and we will see you tonight!

Bryant,

Glad to hear that you are interested in learning more about it. Attached is the syllabus from W22, which I foresee following pretty closely. Here's the link to the Canvas course from that semester (although I'm not sure if you'll be able to get into it): https://byu.instructure.com/courses/13588

Dear BYU student:
On Tuesday, November 8, 2022, a general election will be held in United States for the U.S. Congress and many other political offices.
The BYU Office of Civic Engagement wants students know how to register to vote. The easiest way to register is to visit this survey to be guided to websites that will help you quickly register to vote in Utah or any other state. The entire process takes just a few minutes. This week student volunteers will be available at the tables in the main part of campus to help you register to vote. Look for us and come enjoy a donut as you register or update your registration.
Voting is an important civic duty.  In a representative democracy, it allows us to choose our leaders and provides citizens with an opportunity to influence public policy in their communities. Voting and engaging in civic affairs is also a sacred duty (see General Handbook 38.8.30, "Political and Civic Activity") that leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have long encouraged as we diligently seek to uphold “honest and wise” leaders (see Doctrine and Covenants 98:10). If you are eligible to vote in U.S. elections, please register and then vote in this important upcoming election.   For any who may be worried about voting by mail, or wondering about election security in Utah, BYU Civic Engagement students are hosting an open house on Tuesday, October 18 from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Utah County Elections Division to provide information on how elections operate in Utah County. You can visit the Civic Engagement website for more information and this form to preregister.
I also invite each of you to become more involved in civic affairs. Registering and voting in this election is just the beginning. I hope to see more BYU students involved in Civic Engagement as you complete your education at BYU and I am eager help in that process. 
 
Sincerely,
Quin Monson, Director BYU Office of Civic Engagement

Dear 302 classes,
If anyone is interested, I have posted some Power Point slides (LS > Content) that review some of the major points we covered in each class since the last exam. You do not have to use them, but they are up if you want them for study aids and in helping you fill out your Study Guides, or just for a refresher. 
See you all tomorrow.

Since the catering will be expensive this year I'll need an accurate count of attendance, so, when I send you a more formal invitation in a few weeks, I'll need you to promptly respond.

Yeah I just checked the flight. I would certainly rather get home that night. If my interview ends at 3:30 I feel like I would have enough time, I’d get to the airport by 4 and have about 50 minutes to go through security before boarding ends. 
 
If you know it won’t work out then I guess I’ll have to make the 7:20 flight work the next morning. I’m just saying I’m willing to risk it

Hi Bryant,
                The return flight out of Tucson is a bit tight. It departs at 459 and your interview is not completed until around 315-330.  Can you stay an additional night and leave the morning of the 4th, by chance.

Hi Christopher,
 
November 3rd works great for the interview. I went onto the career website to submit an application and I was looking for a machine learning engineer position but I only saw available positions for that in Chantilly, and none in Tucson. Should I just submit a general application?
 
I would love to chat, I have time tomorrow (Thursday) or Friday anytime after 12. Just let me know when works for you or go ahead and give me a call at 385-500-7272.

Good Afternoon Bryant,
 
I have you scheduled for an interview with us on Thursday, November 3rd beginning at 10 am local time.  We are located at 101 N. Wilmot, Tucson, AZ 85711. You may park in any of the visitor parking spots on the South side of the building.  To enter the building from the south side, you will need to enter ‘1’ on the intercom to contact reception. Please check in at the reception desk for a visitor’s badge.  
 
Please dress appropriately for your interview and feel free to bring a pad and pen to take any notes you desire.  We’ll also be treating you to lunch!
 
If you have not done so already, please log onto our career website at www.rincon.com and submit an application for a specific position of interest or if unsure, a general application.
 
I think it would be very beneficial for us to have a quick conversation as soon as possible to set the stage for the interview, review expectations and to answer any questions you might have.  Is there a good time we can schedule that conversation?
 
We look forward to meeting you!

Hi Christopher,
 
November 3rd works great for the interview. I went onto the career website to submit an application and I was looking for a machine learning engineer position but I only saw available positions for that in Chantilly, and none in Tucson. Should I just submit a general application?
 
I would love to chat, I have time tomorrow (Thursday) or Friday anytime after 12. Just let me know when works for you or go ahead and give me a call at 385-500-7272.
 
Thanks,
 
-Bryant McArthur

Good Afternoon Bryant,
 
I have you scheduled for an interview with us on Thursday, November 3rd beginning at 10 am local time.  We are located at 101 N. Wilmot, Tucson, AZ 85711. You may park in any of the visitor parking spots on the South side of the building.  To enter the building from the south side, you will need to enter ‘1’ on the intercom to contact reception. Please check in at the reception desk for a visitor’s badge.  
 
Please dress appropriately for your interview and feel free to bring a pad and pen to take any notes you desire.  We’ll also be treating you to lunch!
 
If you have not done so already, please log onto our career website at www.rincon.com and submit an application for a specific position of interest or if unsure, a general application.
 
I think it would be very beneficial for us to have a quick conversation as soon as possible to set the stage for the interview, review expectations and to answer any questions you might have.  Is there a good time we can schedule that conversation?
 
We look forward to meeting you!

We could use 3 or 4 helpers for about 45 minutes to store patio furniture.  Either this afternoon (4:00 - 6:00) or tomorrow morning.
Call me if this works for you.

Harbor 4th Ward 
Hi everyone,
Hope your week is off to a great start! We could use your help with a couple of moves this week, both for new families moving into the ward. The first move is tomorrow, Tuesday October 12 for Ryan Lester. Ryan is moving into 434 S 960 W starting at noon tomorrow, but please come when you might be available. The maps app typically is incorrect with Ryan's address so to find his address take a left at 900 W, another right, then left at 1000 W. He has the house with the blue door.
The second move is for the Hunsaker family and they are moving in on Saturday October 15th beginning at 11 am. The Hunsakers' address is 1036 W 430 S. 
If you can help with either of these moves or please let David Christensen know. You can reach David at 801-362-3311 or at dave@davesfarm.com. 
Thanks so much for all your help!

Change to the challenge: 
I’ve learned that the challenge I presented earlier might not be optimal for everyone, so we’re changing this challenge to drop the 3-meal part and just make it: Be intentional about eating at least one more fruit or vegetable each day.
Managing stress:
It's easy to slip into a mode of letting homework take over your life, which makes everything more stressful.  Here are a few things that we've found can really help with this:
	1.	Get help early and often.  If you are stuck on any problem for more than 15 minutes, talk to someone—Professor, TA, classmate, Slack, or Internet.  Don't spin your wheels for a long time on any one problem.  My very best students have also been the ones that asked me the most questions.  The same applies to other life issues: get help if you are feeling overwhelmed or anxious or depressed.  Lots of people want help you—come see us for help. Come see me!
	2.	Remember leg-day: It's more useful to work for 15-ish minutes on each and every problem (work your whole body a little) than it is to get 100% on some of the problems and skip others completely (powerful arms, with neglected legs)
	3.	Schedule in advance when you'll work on homework and how much time you'll spend on it, and then actually stop when the time is up.  Also schedule time for sleep and recreation and other things that are important to you and your health, and then really do those at the time they are scheduled.  If you have no scheduled time to work and play and sleep, you'll feel guilty that you aren't working every time you have a free moment.  This ruins sleep and play and everything else but doesn't really help you get more work done.

The challenge for the week of November 7-11 is to Exercise Your Right to Vote by actually voting in the election on November 8 (or before that, depending on your local percent options).  
The reason I am telling you this now is that you need to make sure now that you are registered to vote, and, if your home state is not Utah, you may need to request an absentee ballot.  To register to vote in Utah, go here: https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html
For those of you that are not American citizens or are otherwise not able to vote in an American election, you can still get credit in one of several ways:
	1.	Vote in an election in your home country (for example, by absentee ballot) if that's an option.  Brazil has an especially important election coming up.
	2.	Choose one major race that is happening in America this month (for example, Mike Lee vs Evan McMullin) and for each candidate, talk to at least one person that plans to vote for that candidate about why they support that candidate.   TV and YouTube videos don't count--you actually have to talk to real people.

Good Evening Bryant,
 
I hope this message finds you well!
 
The conversations that you had with our engineers at the BYU Career Fair led us to believe you would be a valuable candidate to invite for an in person interview in Tucson, AZ (travel expenses are paid for by Rincon).  I’ve outlined a few dates below that currently work for our schedules.  While our interviews are not necessarily an all day event, they are lengthy.  We anticipate a start time of approximately 830am and wrapping the day up at approximately 3pm.  We also include a lunch break where we’ll treat you to lunch!
 
Interview dates tend to be filled very quickly so please feel free to select 2-3 dates in order of preference and I’ll work to schedule the most preferred date available.  After we confirm an interview date, we can select a time where we can commit to a verbal conversation just to set the stage for the interview itself and answer any questions you might have about the process.  
 
October:   20 and 25
 
November:  1 and 3
 
I certainly hope this format works for you and I very much look forward to hearing from you as well as meeting you onsite!

Ok sounds good. I will hopefully have the software ready to go after today/tomorrow. Then we can work on tweaking it and making sure all the bells and whistles are working. Travel safe! Hope you had a fun time

They don’t want to give every office access to the whole google sheet though. They just want to send a pdf version of exactly what they were already giving them before. The dentist does what they will with it and the anesthesiologists will keep their data on the google sheet. 

Headed to the airport right now.

Right now the anesthesiologist has them fill out a form and then they give it to the dentist for their records to fill out and then at the end of the day they collect all the paper work from the dentist. So they need to just send automatically an email to each dentist office right after it’s filled out so we can take out all the paper entirely.

Subject: [MATH 345 - Mathematical Analysis 1 Lab, MATH 402 - Model Uncertainty + Data 1 - All Classes] - This week's challenge: Feed your body well
Date: October 10, 2022 at 2:15:22 PM MDT
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Reply-To: Tyler Jarvis <jarvis@math.byu.edu>

This week's challenge is to feed your body well.
Even if you only care about learning, brains need energy and vitamins to work properly, and you can't concentrate well if you are hungry or malnourished.      
Specifically, I challenge you, starting now, to eat three real* meals every day this week, and to eat at least one fruit or vegetable with each of those meals.
We'll be putting some fruit in the study rooms to help you with that.  Also, the TAs will have granola bars and things in their offices to share with you if you need food.  If you have financial issues or other obstructions that make it hard to get good food regularly, please come see me—I might be able to help you with that.
 
* When I say "real meal" I think you have a good sense of what that is.  It should be something more substantial and healthy than a candy bar or a pop tart, and it should involve some vegetable or fruit.  Use your best judgment and nutritional knowledge to keep with the spirit of the challenge.

Hi everyone,
I just finished grading Exam 1 and they are now posted on LS. Congratulations on a great batch of exams. The scores were really high and I am really excited at how well you did overall. 
The scores posted reflect all points from the Study Guide, which ended up being worth 5.6% of the overall grade. 
The class average was around 86%. The mean was over 88%, which means half the class got over 88% on the exam. We did have scores in the 102% range. So, great job. 
The class average would have been in the 90's had everyone turned in their Study Guides. Over 22% of you did not turn them in. So, those are easy points people are letting fly by. I would strongly recommend turning those in for the next exam if you did not for exam 1. 
Anyway, I hope you have a great weekend. Congratulations again on a great batch of exams.
See you next week.

American Fork Utah South Stake 
Dear Brother and Sisters,

In just two short months our American Fork Utah South Stake will celebrate its fifth birthday. Since that memorable day in December 2017, we have experienced a lot of changes: 2-hour church blocks, home teaching became ministering, and more than 2,000 amazing latter-day saints have moved into our neighborhoods. We have grown from eight wards to twelve wards, and there is no end in sight to the growth our stake will experience in the foreseeable future. Staying ahead of this growth, from an organizational standpoint, is a wonderful challenge. We love the families who are moving in--you are blessing our wards and stake!

As a stake presidency, we recognize our duty to "strengthen our stakes" and are committed to doing so. To address this growth and to best accomplish our efforts to GO and DO the work of salvation, adjustments to ward boundaries are needed.

All members are invited to participate in a Special Stake Meeting on Sunday, October 16, 2022 at 6:00 pm. This meeting will originate from the Alpine Tabernacle, and we ask that members from the following wards attend in person to sustain both boundary and leadership changes:
	•	Harbor 2nd
	•	Harbor 4th
	•	Harbor 5th
	•	Harbor 7th
	•	Pacific Drive 2nd

All other members (those in the wards listed below) are invited to stream the meeting online at https://zoom.us/j/93959347517 :
	•	American Fork 10th
	•	American Fork 16th
	•	Harbor 1st
	•	Harbor 3rd
	•	Harbor 6th
	•	Pacific Drive 1st 

Members of the American Fork 35th ward are certainly welcome (and encouraged) to stream this meeting but will not be required to participate in the sustaining of changes. For those in the stake who may not be aware, our beloved Spanish members experienced a ward division just a few weeks ago, and their ward membership continues to grow at an accelerated pace.

We testify that the Lord leads His church. We have felt of His love and blessing, and we extend this love to each of you. We pray you will join us for this wonderful meeting.

The Stake Presidency 

-----

Queridos hermanos y hermanas,

En solo dos meses, nuestra estaca American Fork Utah South, celebrará su quinto cumpleaños. Desde ese día memorable en diciembre de 2017, hemos visto muchos cambios: bloques de iglesia de 2 horas, el programa de maestros visitantes se convirtió en ministración, y más de 2,000 santos de los últimos días increíbles se han mudado a nuestros vecindarios. Hemos crecido de ocho barrios a doce barrios, y no se vislumbra un final para el crecimiento que experimentará nuestra estaca en el futuro previsible. Mantenerse a la vanguardia de este crecimiento, desde el punto de vista organizacional, es un desafío maravilloso. Amamos a las familias que se están mudando aquí; ¡ustedes están bendiciendo a nuestros barrios y estacas!

Como presidencia de estaca, reconocemos nuestro deber de "fortalecer nuestras estacas" y nos comprometemos a hacerlo. Para abordar este crecimiento y lograr mejor nuestros esfuerzos para IR y HACER la obra de salvación, se necesitan ajustes en los límites de los barrios.

Todos los miembros están invitados a participar en una reunión de estaca especial el domingo 16 de octubre de 2022 a las 6:00 p. m. Esta reunión se originará en el Alpine Tabernacle, y pedimos que los miembros de los siguientes barrios asistan en persona para sostener los cambios de liderazgo y de límites:
	•	Harbor 2
	•	Harbor 4
	•	Harbor 5
	•	Harbor 7
	•	Pacific Drive 2

Todos los demás miembros (aquellos en los barrios enumerados a continuación) están invitados a transmitir la reunión en línea en https://zoom.us/j/93959347517:
	•	American Fork 10
	•	American Fork 16
	•	Harbor 1
	•	Harbor 3
	•	Harbor 6
	•	Pacific Drive 1


Los miembros del barrio American Fork 35 están ciertamente bienvenidos (y alentados) a transmitir esta reunión, pero no estarán obligados a participar en el sostenimiento de los cambios. Para aquellos en la estaca que tal vez no sepan, nuestros amados miembros hispanos experimentaron una división de barrio hace solo unas semanas, y la membresía de su barrio continúa creciendo a un ritmo acelerado.

Testificamos que el Señor dirige Su iglesia. Hemos sentido Su amor y bendición, y extendemos este amor a cada uno de ustedes. Oramos para que se una a nosotros en esta maravillosa reunión.

La presidencia de estaca

All ACME students are invited to come network with ACME alumni next Saturday (October 15) from 4 to 4:45 in the Math Lab.
We have 20 or more ACME alumni that are coming explicitly for the purpose of helping YOU network, to answer your questions about various careers, how they use ACME skills, how to best go about finding a job at their company, and more. 
They remember how hard it was looking for internships and jobs as students, and they are coming solely to help make that easier for you, so unless you already have a job completely nailed down for next summer and beyond, you really will want to go to this.

Your Pell Grant makes you eligible to save on Internet service 
 
Dear Bryant, 
As a Federal Pell Grant recipient, you are eligible for the Federal Communications Commission's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). Congress created the ACP, a new, long-term $14 billion program that replaced the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program. ACP offers your household the following: 
•
An ongoing discount of up to $30 per month to pay for Internet service (up to $75 per month if you live on qualifying tribal lands)
  
•
A one-time discount of up to $100 for a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet purchased from a participating service provider with a small co-pay
  
Many Internet providers offer fully covered Internet plans—meaning you can get high-speed Internet without paying a dime. 
Visit GetInternet.gov to confirm your eligibility, apply, and find an Internet provider that meets your needs. 
Your household cannot receive more than one discount for Internet connection or a connected device purchase, even if several people in your household qualify. 
How to Enroll for ACP 
To apply for ACP, you can fill out an application online, by mail, or through a participating service provider. 
To submit proof that you're a current Pell Grant recipient, you can submit with your application a copy of documents that contain your full name and confirm you received a Pell Grant for the 2022–23 award year, including: 
•
written or electronic confirmation from your school (college or university, community college, or career school) or the Department of Education that you received a Pell Grant;
  
•
your official financial aid offer from your school showing that you received a Pell Grant; or
  
•
a tuition invoice showing that you received a Pell Grant. 
Apply Now
 
 
Have questions about the Affordable Connectivity Program or need info about participating providers near you? You can visit GetInternet.gov, email ACPSupport@usac.org, or call 1-877-384-2575 from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time. 
If you are already enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), you do not need to reapply. Households enrolled in ACP may need to recertify their eligibility annually. The Universal Service Administrative Company, a Federal Communications Commission administrator, will contact you about recertifying your continued eligibility for ACP at a later date. 
 
Your Pell Grant may also qualify you for additional benefits 
A change in federal law has made more students eligible for SNAP. SNAP provides nutrition benefits to supplement the food budget of individuals and families in need so they can purchase healthy food. We encourage you to contact your local SNAP office to find out how to apply and answer questions about your eligibility.

Reply-To: Aaron Schade <aaron_schade@byu.edu>

Hi everyone,
Just wanted to give you a heads-up that I more-or-less disagree with most of the commentary on the Bible Project video for Jonah. I am having you watch it and we can discuss why I disagree. It is pretty skeptical, but does represent an approach/view that we sometimes witness in scholarship: satire. I don't think Jonah has to be read through this lens. If you can access the Introduction video on LS I explain why. Below are some suggestions for accessing the video if you are having problems. If that doesn't work, no worries. We will discuss it in class. I just wanted to warn you ahead of time of the skepticism of the video and that my approach to the text will be different (which we will discuss in class). I actually think the book is quite instructive and teaches some really inspiring messages which highlight our human struggles to extend compassion. 
Hope you all have a great day. See you tomorrow. 
Here are a few tips to help you sign in to the videos if for some reason you are having difficulties.
1. You will not be able to access Zoom recordings for the course unless you are using a BYU Zoom account. Make sure you are using that Zoom account and not another. 
If you don't have a BYU zoom account go to https://zoom.byu.edu > login> and sign in with your ces net id and password. Once you are registered there you should be able to access any videos we use. 
2. If you still have troubles accessing the videos after doing this, you can try signing out of your account and resign back in. Or, click the link of the lecture for that day on Learning Suite and there will be a Prompt for the video to sign in. Scroll down and click sign in with SSO option. 
Fill in company domain = byu
sign in with byu net id and password. 
That should grant you access to the videos.

I am leaving tomorrow morning to Rio, Brazil for a week. I was hoping to at least get the reading assignment quizzes done for the week before I left, but those are not yet posted. As for the homeworks and quizzes will I be able to have an extension for until after I get back? Luckily, I see one homework assignment will be the ethics assignment, which I imagine will be easier( less time-consuming) than a typical math assignment.

I get back Tuesday afternoon October 11 and will then be back in class on the 12th.

Hi Bryant,

There isn't a way to do that. It's only in-person credit for attendance. There is a chance to earn 1 point of extra credit at the end of the semester that will nearly nullify one absence though, so please do that when I announce it.

Hope you have a nice trip.

Brother Hull,

I will be gone the next 3 class periods from Oct 4 - Oct 11. I am going to Rio de Janeiro Brazil with my wife. I have read you syllabus and I understand that it clearly states that I miss 1.5 points for every absence. I am wondering if there is any way I can make those points back up by watching a recorded lecture for example.

Because of the conflict with General Conference, my Saturday office hour is canceled.

Upcoming Challenge (Starting Saturday): Feed your Spirit. Do something spiritually strengthening every day for at least 15 minutes.  
Listening to conference and going to devotional are wonderful, but this challenge is more about making sure you do something meaningful every day.    For me that's usually a combination of prayer, meditation, and scripture reading; but whatever you do, be sure to take time to think deeply about what's most important in your life, how to heal and grow as a person, and how to help others heal and grow.

I'm sorry I didn't reply to your email
BY ISAAC SAUL – 30 SEP 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.” 
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's Tangle: 7 minute read.
	•	An important update about that email you sent me
	•	Our decision to start running ads in Tangle
	•	A callout to the Tangle community for help
For the last several months, I've been attempting to conquer one of the greatest challenges of my writing career: Reader email.
As of last night, I had just over 1,000 unread emails in my inbox, some dating back to the last week of August. That is after I marked all the extraneous emails as "read," leaving nothing but reader feedback and important business inquiries.
This is a tough spot to be in. When I started Tangle, one of my pledges was that I would read every email response that came in (which I've managed to do) and try to reply to all of them, even if it was just to say "got your note, thank you." This was fun and relatively easy when I had 500 subscribers and 20 people replied every day. Three years later, I've mostly kept this promise, but have managed to fall about a month behind on the timeline.
With the midterm season about to hit full swing, our mailing list now nearly 50,000 addresses long, and more emails coming in than ever before (all good things), this mountain of reader feedback became a major stress point and distraction.
So, in extraordinary times, I took extraordinary measures. I decided to read through all 1,000 emails in a day, bite my tongue, and not respond to any of them. Now, I have the stress relief of a normal looking inbox, but the guilt of knowing I failed to reply to hundreds of your thoughtful and thought-provoking notes over the last month.
So today, I'm writing to you to say I got your email, I'm sorry I didn't reply, and please keep writing in.
With my head above water, and some help coming to Tangle, I'm hoping to keep it more manageable so that I'll be more readily able to reply to everyone, even if it's just to let you know I read your feedback. So, if you sent me an email recently, that's my update on it: I read it, I may not reply, but I should in the future.
I also wanted to use this Friday edition to make two other very important announcements.
First, at the risk of burying the lede, I'm here to tell you all that we are going to begin introducing advertisements to the free version of the Tangle newsletter.
As you might imagine, this was a big decision. Much like my promise to always interact with readers, "ad-free" was one of our founding ingredients. It is (was) literally in our tagline, and for a long time I viewed it as a virtuous way to stay independent. But as time has gone on, the Tangle business has grown, and more and more competitors have entered the space, I've realized that the primary result of being ad-free has been, more than anything else, a self-imposed handicap.
By not running ads in the newsletter, I'm losing out on what could be hundreds of thousands of revenue dollars a year — revenue that I could put back into improving our product, growing our team, and most importantly, growing the reach of Tangle. It's revenue our competitors already have and are using to beat us. By running ads in Tangle, I can close that gap and let advertisers subsidize the cost of accessing the content for readers who can’t or don’t want to pay. In that way, it’s a win-win.
Still, in my mind, running ads has always been bad because of the potential appearance of a conflict of interest, the possibility I'd lose readers' trust, and the potential for an ad sales team to screw with our editorial product. The concept represents many of the things I hated about my past journalism jobs. In order to avoid all of this, and to keep the ethos of Tangle intact, we've taken a few steps on this journey.
First, we asked some of you for your thoughts (and, in a not-so-subtle way, your permission). When I started Tangle, I promised to treat paying subscribers like mini-investors who could help shape the future of the newsletter. So we published a survey for Tangle subscribers, who are generally our most loyal and regular readers, and we asked them what they thought about running ads in the free or paid versions of the newsletter.
Nearly 2,000 subscribers took the survey. The overwhelming majority gave us a shrug. 10.1% said it would change how they felt about Tangle if we were to run ads in the free version. 1.3% said it would change how they felt to the degree that they would consider unsubscribing. Just 9.7% of survey respondents, after reading all the possible pros and cons of advertisements, said they thought we shouldn't introduce ads in the paid or free versions. 68.2% said they thought we should, and 22.1% said they were unsure. 83.1% said introducing ads to Tangle wouldn't impact whether they recommended Tangle to others.
 
 
We interpreted these numbers as a mandate to move forward, but with guardrails. After all, it amounted to 9 in 10 subscribers telling us to go for it or that they didn't really mind, and just 1% saying they would even consider unsubscribing. And that was before we came up with a transparent ad policy and promised readers to make our ads as unobtrusive as possible.
Along with the survey question responses, we also got 1,170 comments. The lion’s share came from readers telling us to make the smart business decision and use the money to spread the word about Tangle. A vocal and compelling minority pleaded with us not to run ads. Here is a sample of the range of comments we got:
“Ultimately, you have to make a business model that is sustainable and allows you to compete. Better off doing it now when it’s an option rather than when it becomes a necessity. There are uncontroversial ways of implementing ads. Just don’t overdo it and I don’t think people will respond badly.”
“I think it is wise to be considering the competitive landscape and how to make this sustainable and durable for more than a couple of years. Your work is genuinely important, and you're skilled, compassionate, and intentional. I don't mean to sound grandiose, but I truly believe that it would be a loss to the news landscape, to the country, and to the world, if you had to stop your work because it was drowned by competitors and a business model that ran you to the ground. Take on the ads, work with the investors, network with the competitors — do what you need to do to make this feel stable and sustainable.”
“I recognize how adding ad content feels like a stain against the heart of Tangle. But I think there is a way to manage the businesses you choose to partner with and the way in which the ads are presented that can maintain the spirit of Tangle. The upside of increased revenue and growth is worth it to maintain marketplace competitiveness as well as reach new people with your unique and much needed presentation of news.”
“In the long run it will compromise your business model. You cannot serve two masters. You are either independent or you are driven by ad volume and money. There are no two ways around it, no matter how hard you will try to justify it. I sent a message on LinkedIn by Robin Williams, ‘all politicians should wear their sponsors on their clothes so we would know who is paying for them.’ Thus is the point, you drive revenue with ads, but they own you.”
There were over 1,000 thoughtful comments like this, and I read them all. Then I used them to help develop a transparent policy that I hope will change the minds of many of you who are skeptical about this step.
So, what is that policy? Well, it is now published on our website. You can read it here, but the rough outline is this: We won't ever run political ads, we won't ever promote shady or unproven products, and we won't ever have pop-ups, video ads or intrusive advertisements on our website or in our newsletter. One of our models for advertising is 1440, a newsletter many of you read (we advertise in their newsletter). Like 1440, our ads will only appear in the free version of Tangle, and will be simple and unobtrusive. On the off-chance an advertising partner becomes a subject of our coverage, we will cut ties with them immediately.
Finally, I am creating a traditional firewall between editorial and advertiser decisions in the best way Tangle can. Magdalena Bokowa (magdalena@readtangle.com), our longtime social media manager and my right hand in everything Tangle, will be leading the charge on handling advertisers. I’ll maintain final editorial say on the language they can use in the newsletter. We are not going to hire an ad sales team. We’ll do this in-house, with the Tangle team and the Tangle ethos, and do our best to create relationships with companies who are pushing products we actually believe in.
So, in the coming weeks, if you are on our free list, you might start to see advertisements show up in the newsletter.
For me, this is a bittersweet moment. I’m excited about the prospect of new revenue that will help us expand our reach and develop our team. I’m blown away that, three years into this project, I’m making consequential business decisions — something I was unsure would ever happen in the first place. In the past year, Tangle’s reach and revenue has nearly doubled. This allowed me to go full-time, hire part-time editing staff, take on interns, and ensure a more thoroughly researched and consistently high quality newsletter. We’ve improved our website, launched a daily podcast, and expanded our presence on social media.
But frankly, I’m also a little sad. I feel as if I’m watching my child graduate and go to college. It seems like a concession to the forces of the world we live in, like that original, small, pure thing I started three years ago with an email is changing into something bigger, more consistent, more sophisticated, and just different. So while I’m thrilled about a more sustainable future and glad to be celebrating this milestone, as funny as it is, I also feel nostalgic for the overworked and underpaid days of the scrappy little newsletter that got us here. And with that in mind, I’m pledging to do our best to keep that rugged, independent ethos alive for the months, years and decades ahead.
Going forward, if you don't want ads, you have three options: You can subscribe (and get the ad-free version), you can write in to vent (and try to change my mind), or if you’re part of that 1%, you can unsubscribe (but please don't). I truly hope you all stick around. Even if you’re pessimistic about ads, I’m optimistic the execution will allay your concerns. Also: If you are a Tangle reader who wants to advertise with us, please reach out or fill out this form! I’d love to start with people already in our community.
Now, finally, is my last announcement — and perhaps the most important.
We are going to do a massive charity drive. Since before we even considered introducing advertisements into Tangle, I have — for a long time — been spending a portion of our revenue on advertising in other newsletters. But I'd rather give money to a good cause than to a competitor or another company. Those of you who have been around for a long time surely remember our subscription drives where we would donate a percentage of all new subscription revenue in a week to charity.
So when I saw a campaign Roca News was doing with their readers, I was inspired. They told their readers that for every new subscriber who signed up under a specific link, they'd donate $1 to charity. This created an incentive for their readers to spread the word, and allowed them to lean on their community rather than advertisers for growth.
I was so inspired, I decided to steal their idea and see what we can do with it.
Starting today, every time a new Tangle reader signs up for a free or paid subscription by going to www.readtangle.com/give, we'll give a dollar to a charity fighting hunger. That means you can share that unique link far and wide, and every time someone signs up there, we’ll donate one dollar to Meals On Wheels America (which helps feed the elderly) or No Kid Hungry (which helps feed the kids). We are going to split our donations evenly, and will give regular updates on the campaign.
To recap:
	•	If you emailed me in the last month, I may not be able to respond, but I will try going forward.
	•	Free readers are going to start seeing unobtrusive, non-political, text-based ads in October. If you want ad-free Tangle, you can subscribe. If you want to advertise with us, you can fill out this form.
	•	We would rather give our money to a good cause than advertisers, so we are starting a charity drive. Anytime someone signs up for Tangle from the URL https://www.readtangle.com/give, we're going to donate $1 to charity. Please share that URL far and wide!
Thank you so much for supporting our work, and, as I said, feel free to write in with questions or thoughts! We are excited for the next chapter.
All the best,
Isaac & the Tangle team

Lexi,
 
Yes, Math 320 and Math 322 Algorithm Design & Optimization 1 and 2. As well as Math 436 Model Dynamics & Control 1.  
 
Two other classes I've taken also use elements of signal processing in application: Ling 581R Natural Language Processing and CS 401R Machine Translation (with speech-to-speech translation models). 
On top of that, as I explained to Stuart, my current job at Addavox requires a lot of preprocessing audio speech data using Fourier analysis and Inverse stft. 
 
Hope this helps, I'm also able to take another signal processing class next semester before I graduate and start working at Raytheon if need be.

Hi Lexi,
 
Attached is my transcript. As I spoke with Stuart in my interview I am an ACME (applied math) student at BYU. Signal processing, fourier transform and spectral analysis are all integrated into our core classes (which may not be obvious by the names of the courses).

Harbor 4th Ward 
Hi everyone,
Hope you all are having a great start to your week! There are two new families moving into our ward this week and we could really use your help helping them unload their trucks and settle into their new homes. The first move is tomorrow (Tuesday 9/27) for the Wiggins family. We'll be starting to help the Wiggins at 5 pm but come when you're available since we know many of you may be getting off work at 5. The Wiggins' address is 643 S 850 W Lot 108.
The second move this week is on Saturday 10/1 for the Hansen family who will be moving into the Kelton Apartments. We will likely need help between the Saturday morning and afternoon sessions of General Conference, but we'll email a confirmed time and address later in the week. 
If you're able to help with either of these two moves please let David Christensen know so we can make sure that we have enough help. You can reach David at 801-362-3311 or dave@davesfarm.com.
Thanks!

Another exercise option for the early risers out there:

Climbing at the Quarry (https://quarryclimbing.com)
I top-rope climb every Tuesday/Thursday morning at 6am (more like 6:10 if I'm honest) with a few friends.  You are welcome to join us this week.  Please check the website for costs, and if you haven't gone before you may have to pass a belay check first.  I have a few extra harnesses, but you would need to rent shoes if you don't have any (belay devices just require collateral).  Please let me know ahead of time if you are planning to come so I remember to bring the extra harnesses.

Anyone is also welcome to join me & my 110 lb dog for running at 6am MWF.  I usually run in Vineyard, but could meet up closer to campus.

Great job everyone that did (or is still working on) the weekly challenge this week, fixing your resume and going to the STEM career fair!  Not everyone gets interviews and job offers from the STEM fair, but most people say that the contacts they made at the fair have been helpful.  And almost everyone agrees that the practice they get at the STEM fair helped them be more prepared for the rest of their job search.

The upcoming weekly challenge is to get at least 15 minutes of some sort physical exercise every day.  That doesn't have to be a hard run, or heavy weight lifting--it could be just walking to school, playing frisbee between classes, or an easy bike ride to a friend's house.  The main thing is to get your body moving.

Most of this you'll do on your own, but we have some organized opportunities to exercise together.  Here are a few.

1. Roadbike with Robbie: 
Event: Chill ride along the Murdoch Canal Trail, 30 mins north, then return to the start
Where: Parking lot by Palisade Park and Foothill elementary school (see attached map)
When: Saturday, September 24.  Meet up by 1pm at the red star (see map) and roll out by 1:10pm.
Rules: Obey all traffic laws and be respectful of patrons on the Murdy.  Safety is of the utmost concern, so please wear a helmet, be aware of others at all times, and please no earbuds/headphones.  We won't have supplies for flat tires or mechanicals, so please plan accordingly.  Most importantly, have fun, get to know each other, and enjoy the ride.
This is not a BYU-sponsored event, so in the event of an adverse incident, BYU is not liable.  Pedal at your own risk  😃

2. Jog with Jarvis:
Event: Chill run with Dr. J around the boundary of the BYU main campus (about 3.3 miles)  https://goo.gl/maps/hf8DMUX4WFpexxcD9
Where: Meet at the North-West door of the Richards Building (facing the parking lot and practice field)
When: Wednesday, Sept 28, at 3 pm.  We plan to start running by 3:10.
Rules: Be safe, have fun, and help others have fun. 
This is not a BYU-sponsored event, so in the event of an adverse incident, BYU is not liable.  Jog at your own risk  

3. Dance with the TAs (details coming soon)

Don't be alarmed. There is some difficulty with grade scope and it is not recognizing many students and therefore they have a 0 in the homework sections for 1.1-1.4. If this is you and you did indeed turn in the homework don't freak out. Pay special attention to 1.5.
If you have turned in the assignment and received a 0 please do the following. Go to grade scope and there should be a place in which you can enter your netid (go to account at the bottom left and click "Edit Account"). I need the net id so learning suite can enter the grades automatically (and I don't have to do it manually for every student). If this doesn't fix the problem for when I upload the future scores PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

Subject: 2022 Backend Payment Estimates
Date: September 21, 2022 at 6:30:57 PM MDT
To: bryant0918@gmail.com

Bryant,
Congratulations on finishing your summer!!! We hope you had a great experience and enjoyed your time with us. It’s getting time to start your estimated backend payments, so the purpose of this email is to refresh you on the payment process and let you know what your estimated payments will be.
You will receive estimated payments on the 10th and 25th of each month until April 10th. This is 14 payments. Payment 1-13 is calculated by taking your active serviced revenue (serviced revenue minus cancellations thus far) as of August 31st  and multiplying it by your estimated commission percentage, and then by 80%. Then this number is divided by 14.
Here’s a video explaining how backends will work: https://vimeo.com/600574029/2d6149169a
This formula is expressed as follows:
	•	(Active Serviced Revenue) x (Commission %) x (80%) / 14 = Payment 1-13 
	•	Payment 14 is the remainder owed and is paid on April 10th. 
PLEASE NOTE THAT UNTIL NOVEMBER 30TH, YOUR PAYMENTS ARE ESTIMATED.
After November 30th, we will do a full audit of all of your accounts to determine your retention rate. By January 10th, you will receive a full spreadsheet listing your accounts, details of your retention rate, and a full breakdown of your pay. If needed, we may adjust your monthly estimated payments based on your retention rate at this time.
Based on our preliminary calculations, you will receive the following payments each month:
10th Payroll: $250.74
25th Payroll: $250.74
If something looks significantly off on this estimated payment, please reach out to your Regional Manager or your VP of Sales that you report to. They will be happy to answer any questions you have or look into any questions you have.
Our goal is that this is a simple process for you. We welcome any feedback that you might have.
Thank you and good luck in school this fall.

I met with several STEM recruiters today about ACME and the almost-universal response was "that's just what we want."  Here are a few places that showed special interest today:

Lawrence Livermore National labs.  This is a big organization with lots of groups and divisions, but the "Design Physics" group has a summer internship and they are interested in students who not only could code and do math but also learn new technical things quickly.  That's you.

Southwest Airlines has several possibilities for you (not necessarily represented by the recruiters here, but they still thought their company would like you for these):
1. Network planning: optimizing which planes to send where when
2. Revenue management: optimizing inventory, ticket pricing, etc
3. "The Baker Algorithm group": complicated algorithms for optimal recovery when flights are delayed or disrupted.

Emergent Trading:
They do high-speed trading (finance).  Half of the company is ACME alumni.  They have summer internships and also maybe permanent jobs.

Chicago Ventures
They own Emergent.  They are very excited to get more ACME students hired.

Subject: Notre Dame's ESTEEM Graduate Program in Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Technology
Date: September 20, 2022 at 1:22:49 PM MDT
To: bryant0918@gmail.com

Dear Bryant,
Do you want to launch your own venture but don’t know where to start? Are you looking for a graduate program that can leverage your skills in science or engineering and open new doors, empowering you to Fix Things That Matter?  
“I thought maybe I should try something different, something that would advance my profile, that gets me the opportunity to have a different view and a second career path after graduation. If it weren’t for [ESTEEM] I would still be working in finance doing the same, probably with a lot of money but not happy at all. A decision like that can completely change your life. That’s what happened to me.”  Germán Estrada, ESTEEM ‘17, Founder of 90pct  
Many students come into the University of Notre Dame's ESTEEM Graduate Program feeling restless and boxed in by the career choices laid out in front of them, but full of energy to create a better world and make an impact in the United States and back home. For this reason, ESTEEM emphasizes the action of entrepreneurship, not just the study of it. ESTEEM allows students with technical backgrounds to explore the world of business and entrepreneurship, learning how to combine their current skills with new ones to make an impact fixing things that matter. 

ESTEEM curriculum: 
	•	11 months of transformative experiences 
	•	includes design thinking, customer validation, financial modeling, funding new ventures, data analytics, finance and prototyping
	•	Capstone Project: go-to-market approach with ND-based research, industry-sponsored projects or Founder’s Idea

Hi All,
The exam on Thursday will not have the information in today's and Thursday's class per se. That will be on the next exam, so focus on the information in the study guide you have. Some of our discussions, however, might have some crossover details (dates, events, etc.), so waiting to take the exam till after class on Thursday could be advantageous. But you do already have the details needed in the study guide and the timeline.

Hi All,
I did fail to give you a timeline of dates. Most of the dates are on the slides or we discussed them in class, but this is a quick and easy reference for you. Five questions on the exam are dates, all of which are on this timeline. To make it easier, I've put a red asterisk by 10 of the dates. Those are the ones you need to memorize! You can ignore the others. I'll draw five questions from those 10 highlighted dates, so this should be a useful resource in your study. The pdf of this timeline is now in the same folder under the Content tab with the study guide.

Today's topic.
Lindsey Graham's abortion ban. Last week, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) proposed legislation that would restrict abortion access at the federal level. Graham said the bill would ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest or risks to the mother's life and health.
The bill has no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-controlled Congress, but Graham framed it as a way for Republicans to take a clear position to counter Democrats, and to put the U.S. in line with other Western countries that impose similar restrictions.
"After they introduced a bill to define who they are, I thought it'd be nice to introduce a bill to define who we are," Graham said at a news conference while standing in front of 10 anti-abortion leaders, all of whom were women. "If we take back the House and the Senate, I can assure you we'll have a vote on our bill."
While the bill immediately drew fire from Democrats, who pointed to it as proof Republicans were never interested in leaving the issue to the states, it also drew the ire of Republican strategists. Since the ruling in Roe v. Wade was struck down, polling has shown abortion rights are becoming a major motivating issue for Democratic voters in 2022, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had previously said Republicans would leave such legislation to the states. Some Republicans, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AL) and Susan Collins (R-ME), criticized Graham, calling instead for a bipartisan bill to codify the abortion rights laid out in Roe v. Wade.
Graham also came under fire for contradicting comments he had made previously about leaving the issue up to the states.
“I’ve been consistent — I think states should decide the issue of marriage, and states should decide the issue of abortion,” Graham said in an Aug. 7 interview on CNN, a quote that was shared widely after news of the bill's introduction.
Graham, defending the bill in a Fox News interview, said he has always been consistent in his decades-long effort to ban abortion during the second and third trimesters. “To suggest that I’m new to the game opposing late-term abortion is ridiculous," he said.
In 2019, Guttmacher said there were 629,898 abortions in the United States compared to 1.5 million at the peak of its record keeping in 1991. That year, 93% of all abortions occurred during the first trimester, and 6% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute maintains the most widely cited data on the number of abortions in America (and is cited by groups from across the political spectrum).
We have covered abortion, Roe v. Wade, and Democrats' abortion legislation extensively. You can find those articles here.
Today, we'll look at some responses to Graham from the right and left, then my take.

What the right is saying.
	•	Many Republicans support the idea of the bill, though some worry about the timing.
	•	Some call for Republicans to step up and sell Graham's bill to the public.
	•	Others say there is no need to nationalize the issue, especially right now.
In Politico, Rich Lowry defended Graham's abortion bill.
"The South Carolina senator proposed a national restriction on abortion that has popular support and that could represent a defensible consensus GOP position. For this, he’s being portrayed as a political incompetent who has needlessly endangered his party’s prospects in the midterms," Lowry said. "It’s certainly true that any hope of rallying Republicans was quickly dashed as they, once again, scattered in panic and confusion like a herd of antelope after a big cat shows up at the watering hole. But that reaction is another sign of how badly the party needs to find an incrementalist position on abortion where it can plant its flag, and then focus its fire on the vulnerabilities of the other side.
"The Republicans experiencing a case of sudden-onset federalism on this issue are clearly motivated by political fear," he wrote. "Regardless, the debate at the national level has already been joined. Democrats want to pass the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act that would strike down all state-level restrictions on abortion. If nothing else, Graham’s proposal is a tool in this fight, and the broader battle for public opinion... A Harvard-Harris poll found that 72 percent of voters, including 70 percent of independents and 60 percent of Democrats, don’t think abortion should be permitted after 15 weeks at the state level. According to a Gallup survey, only 28 percent of people believe abortion should be legal in the second trimester and 13 percent in the third trimester. A WPA Intelligence poll shows even 51 percent of voters who think Republicans are extreme on abortion favor a 15-week ban."
In National Review, Alexandra DeSanctis said "the GOP platform has long called for legislating against abortion at the federal level."
"Why is it only now, when in the absence of Roe such a policy actually might take effect, that congressional Republicans have suddenly decided to voice their constitutional objections to federal abortion laws?" DeSanctis said. "There’s hardly a principled case for a 'no' vote now; instead, it seems to be out of fear that their 'yes' will be more noticeable when the bill stands a chance of becoming law. Perhaps the weakest objection to a federal pro-life law is the claim that it will give progressives reason to attempt a federal law legalizing abortion. For one thing, they’ve already attempted that several times, and come quite close to succeeding.
"For another, the progressive case that Congress has the authority to legalize abortion is far weaker than any argument pro-lifers have offered for the reverse," she added. "There simply is no good case to be made that the Constitution protects a right to abortion, and attempting to argue that the Constitution might work in the opposite direction doesn’t give credence to that non-argument. Finally, there are those on the right who fear that the pro-life movement will cost Republicans seats in Congress, and that the national GOP ought to keep quiet on the issue at least until November is behind us. But there’s little reason to believe a 15-week abortion ban is unpopular, much less an albatross."
The Wall Street Journal editorial board said Graham’s proposal is "constitutionally dubious and risks misreading the politics."
"The Democrats’ bill in Congress is far more extreme," they wrote. "Their bill would protect abortion on demand through fetal viability, about 23 weeks. After that line, it would also guarantee abortion access whenever the pregnancy is a risk to the patient’s “health,” which isn’t defined and is often interpreted to include emotional factors. The bill appears to protect sex-selective abortions, if parents who wanted a boy decide they would prefer to terminate a girl. Republicans already had plenty of political ammunition, and signing on to Mr. Graham’s bill leaves them open to charges of hypocrisy.
"After Roe v. Wade, conservatives spent five decades arguing that the Supreme Court had inflamed the country by nationalizing the debate on abortion, which is properly a state issue. This summer the Justices reversed that mistake in Dobbs, and the result has been hurly-burly democratic arguments in state legislatures. There’s no need to re-nationalize the question, and it isn’t clear Congress has the authority to do so," they said. "By Mr. Graham’s political logic, if voters in Colorado, Pennsylvania or Arizona think 15 weeks is too restrictive, they now have a reason to vote against those GOP Senate candidates. Every Republican candidate will be asked to take a stance, and a Senate majority is made by swing states."

What the left is saying.
	•	The left says Graham's bill is extreme and dangerous.
	•	Many call out the Republicans' hypocrisy of a national ban after saying "leave it to the states."
	•	Some refute the idea that the bill would make us more like Europe.
Michelle Goldberg wrote about Lindsey Graham's "unbelievably cruel abortion ban."
"Graham was making an argument, common in anti-abortion circles, that American abortion laws are unusually permissive and that banning abortion at 12 or 15 weeks would bring us in line with Europe," Goldberg said. "France and Spain, for example, both permit abortion for any reason through 14 weeks, and Germany through 12 weeks post-conception. 'If we adopted my bill, our bill, we would be in the mainstream of most everybody else in the world,' said Graham. 'I think there are 47 of the 50 European countries have a ban on abortion from 12 to 15 weeks.' This is, at best, a highly selective reading of European abortion laws.
"It ignores the fact that on most of the continent, abortion is state-subsidized and easily accessible early in pregnancy, so women aren’t pushed into later terminations as they struggle to raise money. More significantly, the restrictions on later abortions have broad exceptions," she wrote. "Take German abortion laws, which are, for Europe, quite stringent. Until this summer, a Nazi-era ban on advertising abortion was still in effect, and abortion is still technically illegal, though it’s been decriminalized during the first trimester. After that, abortion is allowed to protect a woman’s physical or mental health, taking into account her ‘present and future circumstances.’ For low-income women, abortion is publicly funded."
The Washington Post editorial board called it "hypocritical" and "dangerous."
"Only months ago, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham wanted states to write their own abortion rules. Now, he has changed his mind: States should still write their own abortion rules, but only if those rules are harshly restrictive," the board said. "The hypocrisy is obvious coming from a legislator who insisted in May that the Supreme Court, when it handed down Roe v. Wade in 1973, committed a ‘power grab’ by depriving local officials of the ability to decide when and whether abortion should be legal. Yet there was Mr. Graham on Tuesday, announcing his desire for Congress to grab the power to set abortion policy from those very local officials.
"The science behind his arbitrary 15-week threshold is dubious; there’s no consensus on when a fetus begins to experience pain, the point at which Mr. Graham says abortion should be restricted. And his assertion that ‘47 of the 50 European countries’ have smilarly strict abortion rules is bogus. These societies Mr. Graham apparently considers ‘civilized’ may have strict gestational limits on paper. But in practice, most of their legal regimes governing pregnancy termination are forgiving. Generally, exceptions for things such as economic hardship and fetal abnormalities mean that women can get abortions after topline time limits pass, so long as they surmount some bureaucratic obstacles... What’s more, even if a hard-and-fast 15-week rule would align the United States with its peer democracies, Mr. Graham’s bill would not impose a consistent, nationwide policy. His legislation would allow conservative states to continue setting standards as draconian as they desire — which they’ve already started to do.”
In The Daily Beat, Erin Gloria Ryan said the bill was bad policy and dumb politics.
"The question foremost in my mind was: Who is this for? A nationwide abortion ban at a time like this is not only heartless policy, it’s stupid politics—all wrapped up in a bumbling, tone deaf presentation. Sen. Graham’s bizarre choice to announce his 'Just Kidding, Republicans Were Always Going to Try For A Federal Ban' strategy came as Republicans are on the ropes over this very issue," Ryan said. "The threat of banning abortion has galvanized voters from California to Kansas. Special elections that were supposed to be safely Republican—or at least toss-up—have gone to Democratic candidates by wider than expected margins. Polling looks bad for the party of Lincoln.
"Republicans know this. Even the crazy ones. In Arizona, senate candidate Blake Masters’ website scrubbed mentions of his hardline abortion stance (he supports a federal 'personhood' amendment that would declare all fertilized eggs to be 'persons' from the moment of conception, a stance so extreme that Mississippi voters rejected it ten years ago). In Washington, Republican senate hopeful Tiffany Smiley has tried to 'walk a fine line,' both supporting the total abortion ban in Texas and promising voters that she thinks the decision should be left up to the states... The winning message for Democrats in the 2022 midterms is that a vote for a Republican, no matter where they are on the ballot and no matter what they say, is a vote for a rollback of abortion rights."

My take. 
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	I agree that it is bad politics and bad policy.
	•	Graham does deserve credit for doing the logical thing (if you say you believe abortion is murder).
	•	It makes me wonder what the Republicans who criticize him really feel about abortion. 
One of the most interesting pieces of commentary I've seen about this election cycle came from Republican Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.
“There is a campaign about the economy, cost of living, crime and border security, and Republicans are winning this campaign," he told Politico. "But there is a second campaign on abortion, democracy and climate change, and Democrats are winning that campaign."
This strikes me as right on the nose.
Given that, what Graham did (on the same day a very bad inflation report was released) was rather stunning.
When I saw him roll out a press conference to announce the bill, and watched the immediate reaction of Republican politicians, strategists, commentators and voters, I was just perplexed. Nobody really seemed to think this was a good idea. The immediate reaction on the right ranged from a collective "what the hell is he thinking" to conservative commentators accusing him of intentional sabotage.
All the political news, for weeks, has been about the way the abortion fight is motivating Democratic voters, giving them life in a midterm season when they were supposed to get washed out. To see Graham step forward and propose this bill was one thing. To watch the optics of the press conference was another. Graham came out surrounded by women, compared the U.S. to Iran, and was totally unprepared for a reporter's question about her own personal experience of being forced to deliver a non-viable pregnancy.
All the critiques from the left seemed to come in unison because they were all so obvious. This was the opposite of what he said (it should be left up to the states), it was stricter than previous legislation he had proposed (20 weeks), and it was misleading about abortion access in many places in Europe (where it's often free and, unlike his proposed bill, there are broad exceptions).
I have written a lot about my position on abortion and understand many of my readers disagree with me. Putting that aside, what I think Graham underestimated here is just how many horrifying stories have been percolating since Roe v. Wade was struck down, and just how motivating the issue has become for the left. Many of them have been worse than people like me predicted: Women in Louisiana being forced to deliver babies who cannot survive outside the womb. A 16-year-old in Florida who must carry her pregnancy to term because a judge says she is too immature to have an abortion (but not too immature to be a mom). A 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel across state lines to get an abortion. Women facing dangerous, life-threatening ectopic pregnancies who can't get care.
These stories are scary to many, and coming every day, shared widely across social media and in the pages of news outlets, and they are defining the issue. Then in walks Graham, with a national proposal that extends those conditions to voters in states where abortion rights are still robust.
I will say one thing, though, that I'm not seeing many people say: Graham does deserve credit for pursuing an anti-abortion position in earnest. I've excoriated him as one of the politicians (and there are many) who is so slippery and hypocritical and dishonest that he is never worth trusting. His flip-flop on this being a state issue is a good example. But at the same time, he is actually doing one of the logical things to do if you genuinely hold the position he says he holds.
One thing I hear almost every time I talk to anyone in the pro-life movement is the idea that a lot of Republican politicians are pro-life for votes, publicly, but not in earnest. That the issue is not a strong conviction of theirs, just something they peddle during elections. In the eyes of the folks dedicated to ending abortion, there are a lot — and I mean a lot — of Republicans in office who trumpet anti-abortion rhetoric until it's time to actually do something.
For these voters, this proposal isn’t all that restrictive, and all the Republicans freaking out about it are only demonstrating their insincerity. So, while I agree with Graham’s critics that this is bad policy, bad timing, and bad politics, I do think he deserves credit for at least putting his money where his mouth is. If you believe abortion is murder, then the logical thing step to propose a national ban to stop it. If anything, Graham's bill — and the criticism from his purported pro-life Republican allies — begs the question of what they really believe.

Your questions, answered.
Q: You say the way Abbott and DeSantis are handling this [moving migrants north] is cruel. I feel like the question of whether it's cruel has to be measured by the effect it has on the actual migrants. It seems like the question is whether the migrants were better off than if they had stayed put. In El Paso, the city is so overrun that migrants are literally sleeping on the streets. Are we going to argue that they are worse off in DC? I have a hard time swallowing the word cruel as an accurate description here.
— Jeremey, Ft. Worth, Texas
Tangle: I think this is a compelling and reasonable way to frame the question. The Oxford definition of cruel is "willfully causing pain or suffering to others, or feeling no concern about it," so it seems relevant whether these policies are actually causing pain or suffering.
At the very least, the raw outcome here is a complicating factor. The migrants who arrived in Martha's Vineyard, for instance, were showered with food and donations, then taken to a well-equipped facility at a military base in Cape Cod. Do I think they were worse off than the folks sleeping on the streets in El Paso, Texas, surrounded by a community who is probably exhausted by their presence? No. Definitely not.
Still, I think there are a few things worth considering here:
1) Chicago, New York and Washington D.C. are all gigantic cities whose public services are already stretched thin — not just by large homeless populations and the reality of millions of people living in one place, but by the millions of unauthorized immigrants who already live there. Remember: Six in ten unauthorized migrants live in just 20 cities. D.C., Chicago, and New York already have three of the largest migrant populations on that list.
2) We now have hard proof that these migrants were misled. Yesterday, Popular Information published photos of the brochures given to migrants in order to get them to travel to Martha's Vineyard. They included claims that they would receive 8 months of cash assistance, job placement, shelter, food, and housing if they got on the plane. None of that was true. The brochures described benefits available specifically to refugees who had been authorized by the U.N. to live in the U.S.
3) We had reports that some of the migrants were left stranded thousands of miles away from court dates, or simply never got a chance to talk to an attorney or case worker before being put on a plane and sent north or east. This creates confusion.
4) Intent matters. What are DeSantis and Abbott trying to do? Is their goal to give the migrants a better shot at a job, a good life, citizenship, or asylum? Is that even their stated goal? Do you believe that's what they want? Do they even care? When you consider that the definition of cruelty contains “feeling no concern,” I think honestly reflecting on these questions gets you to a place where this policy veers into cruelty.
Again: I've said from the beginning that some migrants may end up better off. “Some very well may end up better off being sent to Washington D.C., New York or Chicago instead of staying in Texas, where resources are already strained and the welcome they get may be much less friendly,” I wrote in our first issue covering this.
I also said I don't mind this policy in theory. In fact, I like it. For the very reasons you laid out: Many border towns are overrun. Many migrants could use a new place to settle. And getting migrants moved around in an organized way, where we can keep track of them and ensure they show up for court, would be a good thing. But for all the reasons above, I still find what is happening here to be cruel.

Under the radar.
The groundwork is being laid for a challenge to Biden's student loan forgiveness. In our edition on the legality of forgiveness, we noted that Republicans will need to find a plaintiff to bring a legal challenge forward, and will also need to decide on a clear angle. GOP state attorneys general, conservative groups and federal lawmakers are now developing that strategy. They can't bring forward a legal challenge until the administration makes a formal move toward cancellation, but they are preparing for that moment. The Wall Street Journal has the story.

Numbers.
	•	96%. The percentage of U.S. adults 18-29 years old who own a smartphone.
	•	61%. The percentage of U.S. adults 65 and older who own a smartphone.
	•	50.2%-42.2%. Brian Kemp's (R) current lead over Stacey Abrams (D) in the Georgia race for governor.
	•	45.8%-44.2%. Herschel Walker's (R) current lead over Raphael Warnock (D) in the Georgia race for the Senate.
	•	$41 trillion. The global wealth increase last year.

Have a nice day.
Carl Allamby had dreamed of being a doctor since he was a kid. The 51-year-old auto mechanic just made that dream a reality. Dr. Allamby opened his first auto shop at age 19, something he said he did out of necessity and desperation. He became a student at night while working his day job, and then enrolled at Ursuline College in Ohio when he was 34. Initially, he went for a business degree, but a few years later found himself in pre-med classes. For five years, he attended weekend, evening and early morning classes until he could start medical school. Seven years after finishing, he got his first job as an attending physician in an emergency room. Fox News has the remarkable tale.

9/1/22: The Coming Forth of the Bible
	•	Bible comes from greek work biblia, which means books / writings  
	•	The hebrew version of the bible is out of order.  
	◦	Tanak 
	▪	Torah (law) 
	▪	Genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, duteronomy 
	▪	Nevi’im (prophets) 
	▪	Ketuvim  (Writings) 
	▪	Psalms, proverbs, job, song of solomon, ruth, lamentations, ecclesiastes, esther, daniel ,ezra  
	◦	This is why the writings are all mixed up, because they separate it by section  
	•	Anytime you see the term new testament in the new testament, it doesn’t actually mean the book, it means the new covenant  
	•	References to the law and the prophets relates back to torah and nevi’im 
	•	Septuagint (LXX) 
	◦	A greek translation of the Torah 
	◦	Supposed to have taken place in the 3rd century BC in egypt 
	◦	Will come to have more books than are included in the tanak 
	◦	Ptolemy II philadelphus sponsors the translation of the hebrew bible  
	◦	Our KJV is based on this translation, not the hebrew bible  
	•	Catholic bible has some books that our bible doesn’t have - called the apocrypha  
	•	The apocrypha is good to know what’s going on, but it isn’t scripture - D&C 91 
	•	Formation of the new testament: oral period at the very beginning - scriptures are being orally passed down by what christ said  
	•	Emergence of new testament: shifting canonical lists from the second to fourth centuries 
	◦	Marcion 140 - minimum books  
	◦	Irenaeus 180 - shepherd of hermas 
	◦	Muratorian canon 200 - wisdom of solomon, revelation of peter 
	◦	Eusebius 325 
	◦	Athanasius 367 
	▪	Mentions other books that are great and can bring you to faith, called the apocryphal, but he still thinks they could be used to deceive  
	•	Dead sea scrolls 
	◦	Biblical texts discovered late 1940s in Qumran, NW shore of dead sea 
	◦	There were over 800 different texts found in the various caves, about 200 belonged to books in the bible (only Old Testament) 
	◦	Scrolls show that goliath was 6’9” instead of what we know to be 9’9”. Average height in that time was 5’2” 
	•	Codex vaticanus 4th century 
	◦	Contained all books in new testament except for part of epistle to the hebrews, pastorals, and revelation 
	•	Codex sinaiticus 
	◦	Found at the base of mt. siyni  
	◦	Has all of our books, plus the epistle of barnabas and shepherd of hermas  
	▪	Shepherd of hermes: baptism for the dead  
	•	Jerome: expert in latin, reads greek and hebrew perfectly. Decides to make a full translation of the bible in latin  
	◦	Vulgate (common): latin translation of the bible

ACME Seniors,
This is a reminder that the ACME textbook PDFs are copyrighted and are not to be shared with people outside the class. 
When you share a copy with someone who is not enrolled in the class, you are essentially stealing from SIAM, who is a nonprofit publisher and who has been very generous in the publication of our books, printing hardbound, color copies for less than it would cost to photocopy the notes. 
Please do not give the PDF or other copies of the notes to employers, friends, co-workers, or others.  These are only for students currently enrolled in the course.
Thanks!

If you would like to respond to this notification, please place your response above the dotted line. 


Rockwell Ranch MASTER member,
A few community updates regarding the Clubhouse campus.
 POOL:
Thank you for your continued patience as the Keystone Development works with American Fork City and Utah County Health Department to finalize the approval for use of the pool. It is unlikely that the pool will be open for use for the 2022 season, which is a disappointing fact. They will continue to work diligently to ensure that the pool will be open for the entire 2023 season for community enjoyment. 
 CLUBHOUSE: 
Reservations are now available for booking the use of the clubhouse for activities. This shared amenity is for private party use only and is not available for commercial use or events, such as weddings. Owners or their tenants will be responsible to be aware of the rules listed on the website, the cleaning list when done using the facility, and that there is a $25 non-refundable usage fee to help offset the overall cost to clean and maintain the building monthly. 
Reservations are available on a first come/first serve basis and for a maximum of 4-hour blocks. The calendar will show if the desired date is available. Some holiday or high demand days will only be available via a draft of those wanting to use the facility on that day. 
 The reservations form is split into two categories:
                OWNER = will be directed to their personal HOA account portal to pay the $25 usage fee.
                TENANT = will be directed to a PayPal page to pay the $25 usage fee. 
https://www.amres.co/property-owners/clubhouse-reservations/rwr-clubhouse/
 PICKLEBALL COURT:
This area is open from 8 AM – 10 PM on a first come/first served basis. The lights come on via a photocell at dusk for nighttime playing. Please use courtesy in this area to the surrounding neighbors and to keep food out of the court. 
If you have any questions, you can email hoahelp@amres.co with your inquiry. No reservations will be made over the phone or outside of the automated website system. However, if you are having issues accessing your portal, Advantage Management is happy to help assist you. 
 

Sincerely, 
Advantage Management and Real Estate Services on behalf of ROCKWELL RANCH TOWNHOME OWNERS ASSOCIATION INC (801) 235-7368 | amres.co

The upcoming weekly challenge is to

	2.	Set up a LinkedIn account and put your resume information there.
	3.	If you don't already have a job or an internship lined up for summer 2023, go to the STEM career fair this coming week.
For the weekly challenges, please report your progress on the challenge each week on the last homework assignment of the week (the one due your homework due before Monday class).  To keep things easy for the TAs, please put that in the UPPER RIGHT CORNER of the first page.   
We will plan to bring kolaches to each classroom where at least 75% of the class members completed at least 4 challenges.  
Also, it's time for class presidency elections.  If you are interested in running, please send to acmeasst@mathematics.byu.edu the name of your running mate (president or vice president), a photo of you and your running mate, and a brief paragraph explain why your classmates should vote for you.  We need this by the end of the day on Wednesday.

Subject: Bryant, Notre Dame can help you facilitate social change
Date: September 16, 2022 at 8:22:51 AM MDT
To: bryant0918@gmail.com


 
Dear Bryant:

Since its foundation over 175 years ago by Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., the University of Notre Dame has strived to be “a powerful force for good.” The University’s commitment to fostering a just and humane society—a commitment entrenched in Catholic social tradition—undergirds a learning environment that endows students with resources aimed at developing them into ethical leaders governed by a sense of human solidarity and concern for the common good. 

The late Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., 15th president of the University of Notre Dame, modeled such leadership during his thirty-five year tenure, making "his mark not only on higher education but also on many of the era’s pressing social issues, including civil rights...and nuclear proliferation." 

Graduate students at Notre Dame are empowered through:
 
 
LASER (Leadership Advancing Socially Engaged Research)
 
 
Opportunities to integrate social justice considerations into personal and disciplinary interests
 
Workshops on community engagement
 
Multidisciplinary training in peacebuilding with the goal of addressing violence and alleviating human suffering

As a graduate student at Notre Dame you will be empowered to be a "force for good" in the world. What will you do?

Sincerely,

John Lowery, Ph.D.

Hi All,
Our first midterm will start next Thursday, Sept. 22nd and continue to Friday the 23rd. It will take place at the Testing Center, so bring your student ID and a pencil. Please check the hours for the Testing Center on their website, but usually the times are 8:00 am to 9:00 pm (i.e., last test goes out at 9:00 pm). 
The study guide will appear under the Content tab on Learning Suite today at 5:00 pm. I give you a series of concepts to study on the first page, and then a series of slides to study. Please note that I often give you hints about what's important in each slide, so pay attention to those notations. 
Review your notes and the Bible Dictionary entries (many of which will correspond to the items on the first page of the study guide). 
The test is all multiple-choice. And as I mentioned, I would wait till after class on Thursday to take it if I were you, but you're welcome to do it before class if you're confident. 
Best, Prof. Hull

Hi Prof. Hansen,

Thanks for getting back to me, and thank you for being willing to change those grades after the semester is now over. 

Canvas still hasn't updated those changes yet on my end. If you haven't made the adjustments yet, then I'm sure you will soon. Otherwise, I just wanted to let you know that I don't see the changes.

Lastly, I want it to reflect the A- on my transcript instead of the B+. Is there anything else I will have to do with the registrars office to make that happen? 


Thanks again, 
-Bryant McArthur

Hi Bryant,

I apologize I'm just now emailing you. Both your emails went to my junk folder, so I did not see them.

Regarding the grades for those two assignments, your name was not listed for those who attended the library session and Wayne didn't let me know that you contacted Letty. So, I will change that to reflect the correct grade. For the evaluation, I understand you want to receive credit and your team did do a great job on the project; however, because you didn't submit it on time in Canvas, I can't give you full credit for the evaluation.

I will update canvas and change your grade to reflect what the syllabus states though. I hope you had a great rest of your summer and are having a good start to your fall semester! Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
Prof. Hansen

Professor Hansen:

I have not heard back from you regarding these two homework assignments. They both still appear as a 0 for me on Canvas. 

Canvas also shows that I earned a 90.64% in the class but that I earned a B+ even though the syllabus clearly says that anything between 90% and 93% deserves an A-. I understand this is was probably not intentional on your end. If you could fix that it would be greatly appreciated, and you won't have to worry about a few extra points from those two "missing" assignments either.

Thank you,

-Bryant McArthur

I have a zero on two different assignments that I believe I deserve credit for. The first is the Library Research Activity and the second is TP.8 Team Evaluation.

Library Research Activity
I was originally working with Wayne the TA to get my grade changed on this and he said he would, but it never got done. I wasn't able to attend one of Leticia's group sessions, but I set something up with her individually and she told me she would let the professor know that I attended so that I could get full points. This was near the beginning of the term and I mistakenly told her that Liz Dixon was my professor.  That is probably why you and Wayne never got the report of my attendance.

Let me know if you want me to send you a screenshot of our email correspondence in order to get full points for the Activity.

TP8. Team Evaluation
It appears that the team evaluation I created never got submitted. In the best interest of my teammates, they deserve for you to know how much work and effort both of them went into this project. We received the highest grade in the class for both parts of the project and that is a reflection of the time and effort from all 3 of us.

I thought the evaluation got submitted, but we were scrambling all day to make up for our 4th teammate who dropped the class just two days earlier. That's an easy 10 points of our final team project that I should have credit for and does not provide an accurate representation of my effort after all our hard work. Attached is my evaluation.

Please let me know if you are not able to change both of those grades, otherwise I am expecting a slight bump in my final grade for the class.

Thank you so much. Even though I'm a math major, the communication skills I have learned this summer have already helped me at my current Machine Learning Internship.

Date: September 13, 2022 at 4:39:13 PM MDT
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Reply-To: Matthew Steffen <steffen.matthewj@gmail.com>

I have a couple of requests/announcements for y'all:
	1.	I AM CHANGING MONDAY OFFICE HOURS: from 6:00-7:00 pm -> 4:00-5:00 pm (due to a fairly common request for an earlier time).
	2.	I will give everyone a template jupyter notebook to be used in ALL coding assignments. Starting Monday I will be fairly particular with how coding is formatted and turned in (this applies primarily to assignments where a majority is coding). I will get that format to you by Friday. For the work turned in I'll take what I can get.
	3.	When submitting images please do the following:
	1.	Make sure the orientation is correct (It is difficult to turn my head 90 degrees to read your work)
	2.	Make sure the problems are separated enough so it is clear where one ends and the next begins.
	3.	Please make sure your picture is high quality (poor lighting with pencil renders the writing illegible), unfocused images are also impossible to decode.  Zoom in enough (grade scope does not allow a lot of room for your images, and that goes for those using OneNote or turning in a single page continuous and giant page).
	4.	When the answer is open-ended please make sure your final answer is somewhat clear (at least not in the middle of the proof).
	5.	If you want detailed feedback or descriptions of the homework (especially as exam times come around) I hope to trail behind only a few days with an accurate detailed solution that can be seen upon request (only in person).

Subject: [MATH 402 - Model Uncertainty + Data 1, MATH 321 - Algorithm Design + Opt 1 Lab - All Classes] - Ethics and morals of the companies you apply to
Date: September 13, 2022 at 11:30:55 AM MDT
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Reply-To: Tyler Jarvis <jarvis@math.byu.edu>

You may not think of math as being a subject with lots of ethical and moral dilemmas, but the ways that math and computing are used can be very dangerous,  unethical, or immoral.  Because of that, you'll want to look carefully at the companies you apply to for jobs and internships and ask yourself whether you'd be comfortable supporting the things that company is doing.  
I won't tell you what your morals should be, but I hope you'll at least think about whether it is right to work for companies that sell harmful products like tobacco, gambling devices, or pornography.  Consider also the issues of working for companies engaged in predatory lending practices or those who play a role in causing the opioid epidemic in America.  Many companies also misuse private data for their own gain.  Facial recognition technology developed by mathematicians is being used in China for violent racial discrimination against the Uyghurs.  Other technologies claim to do good, like facial identification of criminals, but don't work well, resulting in significant harm to others, like false arrests of people who don't look remotely like the supposed criminal.  
This doesn't mean you can never work at a company that has ever done something bad, but you'll be happier and sleep better at night if you think hard about these things before you even apply, and especially before you accept a job offer.
Here are some articles that you might find interesting in this regard:

Subject: The Old Testament: Christopher Miner responded to your question
Date: September 12, 2022 at 9:45:31 PM MDT
To: bryant0918@gmail.com


The Old Testament: Christopher Miner responded to a question in The Divided Kingdoms Readings that you wanted to know the answer to 
5 hours ago, you asked this question on Perusall: 
Who forced him to change his name and why? The two names are very similar but the first refers to Elohim or God the Father, and the second refers to Jehovah or Christ. 
Christopher Miner just responded to the question by saying: 
Super good question, i think to answer it one has to first clarify that El/Elohim really just means "God" and thats often how jews used it, as an epithet for the god they worshipped, Jehovah. (though other canaanites/semitic peoples also worshipped some form of El who they believed was the father God, sorta similar to Heavenly Father) Originally, Jews knew that El and Jehovah were two separate beings like we know today and that Elohim was the father of Jehovah, but during this period the two identities kinda merged and they thought of it like two names for one God. So to the jews both Elohim and Jehovah just meant "God", but El/Elohim is a more universal title since Canaanites/other semitic people also worshipped a God named El, but since only the israelites worshipped "Jehovah" that epithet was seen as more national or only applicable to the God of the Israelites. Anyways... One idea i've heard is that Eliakim's name means "Whom El has set up" and El here is a more universal epithet for God, whereas Jehoiakim means "Whom Jehovah has set up" and is therefore using the epithet Jehovah which is a more national name for God. All the Semitic peoples worshipped El, only the Israelites worshipped Jehovah. By making his name Jehoiakim the Pharaoh is essentially saying Jehoiakim is only supported by the little god of his nation, not some universal God, and therefore Pharaoh and his gods still had power over him. Once again just an idea I heard but to me it makes sense in the context!

¡Hola a todos!

Oh boy what a week! We found out transfer news last night and Elder Zimmerman and I will be staying here at least one more transfer here in St. George. We have a lot of momentum here so we are excited to continue to gather Israel in this particular part of the Lord's vineyard.

This past week we started teaching quite a few different people! One highlight is that we finally were able to have a lesson with 4 kids who are between 9-12 and they all want to be baptized as soon as possible! Their names are William, Jennifer, Kyla, and Jaycee. They will all be baptized on October 2nd with their friend Eva, who is also another unbaptized kid. And it turns out that they are all already friends so that was a cool miracle!

Elder Zimmerman and I brought out the bikes this week! Our car finally got a hitch receiver installed and now we are able to hook up a bike rake and take our bikes to whichever part of our area we want! It's awesome! We've been mapping out our area during the slower parts of the day by knocking doors to find out where the hispanics live. Then we go back at night if we don't have any lessons scheduled with our bikes and hit up only the homes we know are Spanish. Most Latinos don't get back from work until about 7-8pm so we have a very limited time frame to get in contact with them. But bikes have made it easier to be more effective with our time.

Our friend John Hildrovo got baptized this past week! You may remember John, we taught him for a week or so but passed him off to the English Elders because he spoke better English than Spanish. However, he got baptized yesterday and we got to attend that and it was amazing! John is so ready to let God prevail in his life; you can just tell.

I've really been thinking a lot about this one quote by Thomas S. Monson this past week:

“To find real happiness, we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves. No one has learned the meaning of living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellow man. Service to others is akin to duty﻿—the fulfillment of which brings true joy"
Thomas S Monson

President Monson speaks the truth! I have been constantly reminded of how selfish I tend to be and find that only when I am focused on others is when I truly feel joy! I am currently working on surrendering my ego to the service of my fellow man. It's such a hard thing to do! But I can feel the Spirit's reassuring presence as I do. It's worth it. I testify to that!

I invite you all to take an internal assessment of the level of happiness in your life at this moment. If you wish it was more, I invite you to focus your efforts this week on surrendering your ego to "the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees” D&C 81:5. I promise as you do so, more joy and definite purpose will come in unmeasurable ways you never thought was possible.

Love you all! 

Elder Rasmussen

Hey everyone! This is your TA for Old Testament!

Good job on your papers and response videos! The main thing people lost points for was not making their video at least three minutes long so make sure to do that next time.

There were a few of you whose videos I couldn't access. If this is you, please email me your video and I will get it graded today!

Also, there were a number of you who wrote and said "Kirkland" instead of Kirtland. Just something to look out for haha.

The Old Testament: Evie Larson responded to a question in Temple Readings that you wanted to know the answer to 
4 hours ago, you asked this question on Perusall: 
It doesn't seem that subtle. Why would Adonijah ask Bath-sheba to do that for him when she and Solomon would obviously know he's trying to take the throne? 
Evie Larson just responded to the question by saying: 
I thought this comment was interesting because Adonijah had already been decided against by David, yet he continued to try for the throne. Power meant more to him than his father's wishes.

Hi Bryant,
 
I don’t see you name on the rolls either, so contact the university tomorrow morning and try to figure out what’s going on. There are readings due tomorrow and a quiz that opens after class. Here’s the assignment as it appears on LS:

Read from the Bible Dictionary (see pdf under "Content" tab): God; Jehovah; Jesus; Eden, Garden of
 
Read the article(see pdf under "Content" tab): “The Father and the Son: A Doctrinal Exposition by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles”
 
Then take the quiz.
 
Assuming you get things straightened out, do the reading for tomorrow (attached here, but from then on you’ll find readings under the “Content” tab). 
 
Let me know in class if you’ve worked things out.

HI ACME friends, 

This is your weekly email of career-related information. It's recruiting season and these emails are important for those of you looking for internships or jobs (hopefully all of you)!

1. Do you need a resume review? I can help you edit and optimize your resume. Feel free to schedule an appointment with me at this link: https://calendly.com/rlewis-8 
I typically have two weeks of appointment time slots open at a time. 

2. Come hear from a few ACME seniors as they discuss their internships during the Careers in Math internship Panel tomorrow --Wednesday, September 7 at 4 pm in 1170 TMCB. It's so helpful to learn from your peers. There will also be treats. 

4. Raytheon is hosting an event and hopes ACME students will attend. It's Thursday, Sept 8 in room 301 TMCB from 3-4 pm. (Flyer attached)
If you're not available to attend at that time, feel free to join another session on Thursday 9-10:30 am or 1-2:30 pm in the Engineering Bldg, Weidman Center

5. The STEM Fair is Wednesday, September 21. Look for details of who is coming to the STEM Fair here on Handshake. BYU Career Services has put together a list of helpful tips for the STEM & Career Fairs. 

6. Here is a link to the Math Dept Airtable. This is a spreadsheet of many companies that have hired our ACME and Math students over the years. There are a few additions to make though, so it is not an exhaustive list.

7. I've attached a flyer for Goldman Sachs as well. Goldman Sachs will be visiting Careers in Math on Sept 21 and Career Essentials on Sept 28. More info to come!

¡Buen día a todos!

This past week went by super duper quick. We had Zone Conference on Thursday and it was fantastic. President Staples shared with us the formula for miracles and I thought I would be selfish if I didn't share it with you guys! The formula is as follows:
Faith+Works+Prayer=Miracles
Pretty cool right? If any one of you is seeking and expecting miracles apply this formula in your own life I urge and beg you to apply this! I promise as you do so, "then may [you] stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed." (Doctrine and Covenants 123:17)

Thank you to everyone who chose to participate in fasting for a miracle in the life of Ryan! We are continuing to teach him and we are continuing to pray for a way to appear so that he may be baptized as soon as possible. This past week, before Sunday, Ryan asked us if he was allowed to share his testimony on Sunday. We said of course and on Sunday he proceeded to give the most heartfelt testimony about how grateful he is to have the Gospel in his life right now, even though the circumstances of his life are less than ideal. He actually had to be asked to sit down because of how much time we were over the hour at that moment but he said he will give the next half of his testimony next month! He is so awesome.

One of the goals Elder Zimmerman and I had as a companionship this week was to get a member out to lessons with us every day. We were able to every day but one! The difference it made to have a member with us was huge! I honestly think it might have a little to do with having another Latino with us, instead of two white guys, but nevertheless it helped a lot! The members who accompanied us were able to form real connections with our friends and we saw our friends open up more and more. It has also provided an opportunity for the members who have served missions to feel the spirit of missionary work again which gets them even more fired up to come out with us again!

A bishop of one of the English wards we cover told Elder Zimmerman and I this yesterday and I wanted to share it: 
"The mission is not the best two years of your life, it's the best two years FOR your life."
As I continue to ponder on this simple statement, I can't help but agree. My time as a missionary to this point has been far more humbling, difficult and challenging than I could have ever imagined beforehand. My definition of success is being constantly refined day after day. However, as I focus my thoughts and efforts outside of myself, I am finding more and more peace and happiness. This peace comes from acknowledging that I have a Savior, who knows me personally. It is He who has gone through every single thing that I have and will yet go through. As I strive to rely on His merits, and his mercy I feel like he is shaping me into the disciple he wants and needs me to be. It's a very uncomfortable process, but one that is very worth it. I look back on the experience I have had so far as a missionary and I would not trade it for anything in the world. I am laying a foundation for the rest of my life and for the rest of eternity. For any of you thinking about serving a mission; do it. Take the leap of faith. Trust in the promise the Lord has given us: "lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul" (Doctrine and Covenants 4:4)

Lay up salvation to your soul! Perish not!

Elder Rasmussen

Check-in requirements vary by airline, so if your ticket includes travel on other airlines, please check with the operating carrier on your ticket.  Do you have comments about our service? Please email us to share them.  ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY  Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a carrier’s own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.  Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  Conditions of Carriage  Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:  • Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage. • Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us. • Our right to change terms of the contract. • Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage. • Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting. • Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.  These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you. You may view these conditions of carriage on delta.com, or by requesting a copy from Delta.  You have received this email because you elected to receive your Electronic Ticket receipt sent to you via email. If you would like to take advantage of other Delta email programs featuring special fares, promotions, information and flight updates, please visit: delta.com/emailprograms or delta.com/notifications  This document establishes the creation of your electronic EMD(S) in our computer systems. It does not constitute a document of carriage. Where this document is issued for transportation or services other than passenger air transportation, specific terms and conditions may apply. These terms and conditions may be provided separately or may be obtained from the issuing agent.   Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:  If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (www.delta.com/appr) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.  Si l’embarquement vous est refusé, ou si votre vol est annulé ou retardé d’au moins deux heures ou si vos bagages sont perdus ou endommagés, vous pourriez avoir droit au titre du Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens, à certains avantages au titre des normes de traitement applicables et à une indemnité.

Sure.
The reading quizzes in general will close at the start of class, although the one for the first day was supposed to close at the end of class.

Hey quinlan,

I was in class yesterday and tried to take the pandas 1 quiz but it had already closed. I now see that the quizzes need to be taken before class and I should have checked before the first day. However, just because it was the first day, will you reopen the quiz so I can take it?

Hi everyone, 
Please complete the following for Thursday. You can see these on Dashboard on LS, but I find it easiest to just click on the Assignments Tab and work your way through the material (sometimes the order of the Assignments gets mixed up on Dashboard). If you just added the class and need some extra time catching up, just let me know. 
1. Complete the Syllabus Quiz module (Family video, syllabus overview - you don't need to watch the OT introduction video if you were in class the first day). Then take the syllabus quiz in the module for that day.
2. Complete work for Job in the Assignments Tab. Just start at the top and work your way down. Watch the initial Job Overview video. After that, if you would like some sort of introduction prior to starting your readings, you can watch the Historical Introduction to give you some background. See Announcements for some suggestions if you have any problems accessing the videos. If you want to go straight to the readings without watching the video, you can. 
3. Complete the Job readings by clicking on the Launch External Plugin. Please only access this through LS on not on Perusall's homepage. 
4. If you are in class for the Job discussion, you don't need to watch the "Lecture - Job" video. 
5. Take the syllabus quiz and you are done. 
Let me know if you have any questions. See you on Thursday.

Reading and HW are posted under "Content" tab on LS.  As mentioned on Slack, you should skip problem #4 and any problems with a *.
Get on Slack, if you aren't yet.
Homework is due at 11 pm (Gradescope doesn't have an 11:59 option, unfortunately) the day before the next class, so Section 1.1 is due on Tuesday night at 11.

I just listened to a Zig Ziglar book and really like this:

You are at the Top when...
You clearly understand that failure is an event, not a person, that yesterday ended last night, and today is your brand new day.
You have made friends with your past, are focused on the present, and optimistic about your future.
You know that success doesn't make you and failure doesn't break you.
You are filled with faith, hope and love; and live without anger, greed, guilt, envy or thoughts of revenge.
You are mature enough to delay gratification and shift your focus from your rights to your responsibilities.
You know that failure to stand for what is morally right is the prelude to being the victim of what is criminally wrong.
You are secure in who you are, so you are at peace with God and in fellowship with man.
You have made friends of your adversaries, and have gained the love and respect of those who know you best.
You understand that others can give you pleasure, but genuine happiness comes when you do things for others.
You are pleasant to the grouch, courteous to the rude and generous to the needy.
You love the unlovable, give hope to the hopeless, friendship to the friendless and encouragement to the discouraged.
You can look back in forgiveness, forward in hope, down in compassion and up with gratitude.
You know that "he who would be the greatest among you must become the servant of all."
You recognize, confess, develop and use your God-given physical, mental and spiritual abilities to the glory of God and for the benefit of mankind.
You stand in front of the Creator of the universe and He says to you, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."

Here are a few tips to help you sign in to the videos if for some reason you are having difficulties.
1. You will not be able to access Zoom recordings for the course unless you are using a BYU Zoom account. Make sure you are using that Zoom account and not another. 
If you don't have a BYU zoom account go to https://zoom.byu.edu > login> and sign in with your ces net id and password. Once you are registered there you should be able to access any videos we use. 
2. If you still have troubles accessing the videos after doing this, you can try signing out of your account and resign back in. Or, click the link of the lecture for that day on Learning Suite and there will be a Prompt for the video to sign in. Scroll down and click sign in with SSO option. 
Fill in company domain = byu
sign in with byu net id and password. 
That should grant you access to the videos. 
As you work your way through each module for the day, please only access any material we use for the course through the modules we have provided on LS. If you try to access the readings through any other channel, you will be locked out of LS grades and your scores and work will not be credited. 
We will talk more on Tues and try and answer any questions you still have. 
Have a great weekend and welcome to a new semester. Looking forward to studying the Old Testament with you.

Dear Old Testament Students,
Welcome to the Old Testament. My name is Aaron Schade and I will be your instructor for the semester. 
Before class on Tuesday, please access Learning Suite, read through the syllabus (found in Content on LS), and watch the Introduction to my family video and the Introduction video posted for the first day of class. You can access everything through the Assignments tab on LS and by clicking on the learning module for that day/lesson. Those videos total about 22 minutes and will introduce you to me and my family, how to navigate LS, and how access the assignments and material needed for the course. There is another Introduction to the Old Testament video listed in that day's assignment, but you don't need to watch it if you are attending class. I have put that up for those who are sick, adding the class late, or who are unable to make it to our first class period. So, skip the 40 minute video if you will be in class on Tuesday. 
You can find the assignment material on LS under Assignments. You will need to read over the syllabus and take a short syllabus Quiz. The syllabus can be found on LS under the Syllabus tab. The quiz is found at the bottom of the day's lesson under assignments. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or my TA (listed on LS).
I am excited to get to know you and study the Old Testament together. See you on Tuesday.

Seth Goldman on the Not-So-Sweet End of Honest Tea
The case of Honest Tea stood out as a model for social entrepreneurs. The company produced a healthier, fair trade, organic product and reached millions of new consumers when Coca-Cola bought the company. Then Coca-Cola decided to discontinue the line. Seth Goldman ’95, one of Honest Tea’s co-founders, talked with Yale Insights about that “gut punch,” lessons he has learned as a social entrepreneur, and his plans to return to tea.

To Be Happier at Work, Think Flexibly about Your Job—and Yourself
The benefits of “job crafting”—a practice first described by Yale SOM’s Amy Wrzesniewski 20 years ago—are well established. In a new paper, she and her co-authors find that well-being can be further enhanced by pairing a shift in your job mindset with changes in how you think about your own strengths and weaknesses.

Dr. Fauci retires.
BY ISAAC SAUL – 24 AUG 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle: an independent, ad-free, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day — then “my take.” 
First time reading? Sign up here. Would you rather listen? You can find our podcast here.

Today's read: 12 minutes:
Dr. Fauci retires, some changes to Tangle, and a recap of last night's midterm results.

Some changes.
In an effort to create the best newsletter possible, I have always pledged to incorporate reader feedback into adjustments that we make. Starting today, you'll notice two changes to Tangle that are the product of repeated reader requests:
1) I'm going to start using bold fonts more regularly, and bolded, bullet-point summaries of "my take." We first started the bullet point summaries of the right and left arguments a few months ago so people could skim the newsletter faster when they were short on time. But quite a few readers have said they wished they could get those summaries of "my take," too. While I want Tangle to be a longer-form, more in-depth and nuanced politics newsletter, I also know your time is precious. So we're going to start using bold fonts (like this) to highlight "must-read" sections of the newsletter so those short on time can get to the core of the issues if they need to.
2) The "Story that matters" section will now be dubbed "Under the radar." Quite a few people have suggested that a section named "Story that matters" implies other things in the newsletter are less important, which is a good point. Really, I want to have a section about a story I think should be getting more attention but isn't. Hence, the introduction of "Under the radar."

Today's topic. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci. On Monday, Dr. Fauci announced that he will be stepping down in December. Fauci's plan to retire from government was initially reported in July, but the 81-year-old made it official this week. Fauci is currently serving as Biden's chief medical advisor and the government's top infectious disease official, and is best known for navigating the American Covid-19 response under two administrations. He heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is chief of NIAID’s Laboratory of Immunoregulation. He will be stepping down from all three positions.
Fauci's departure comes at a time when Covid-19 cases remain still high and the Biden administration attempts to pivot to meet the public's changing sentiments on how to handle the virus. As we covered on Monday, the CDC has relaxed Covid-19 guidelines while its director has called for re-evaluating the organization after its failed Covid-19 response. Fauci’s retirement follows the resignation of Jeffrey Zients, another top White House pandemic official who departed earlier this year.
“As he leaves his position in the U.S. government, I know the American people and the entire world will continue to benefit from Dr. Fauci’s expertise in whatever he does next. Whether you’ve met him personally or not, he has touched all Americans’ lives with his work,” President Biden said in a statement.
Fauci led the NIAID under seven different presidents over the course of nearly four decades. Before Covid-19, he was a highly regarded figure across the political spectrum and best known for his work on the HIV/AIDS crisis.
During the pandemic, however, Fauci became a very divisive figure. Democrats praised him for what they viewed as realistic outlooks on the virus, often undercutting a more rosy picture put out by the Trump White House. Republicans became deeply critical of him, however, saying he overstated the authority government agencies had to enforce mandates and social distancing measures and offered contradictory directions on mask-wearing. Over time, he was also criticized for not recognizing — as many other epidemiologists didn’t — that asymptomatic people were the primary spreaders of the virus early on.
In 2020, Fauci had to begin traveling with an armed security team after a series of death threats.
Today, we're going to hear some arguments from the left and right about Fauci's legacy and his retirement, and then my take.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left praises Fauci's career, saying he leaves a strong legacy.
	•	Some argue that his advice on Covid-19 was mostly on the mark, even if he got a few things wrong.
	•	Others say Fauci managed to deftly navigate the politics of Washington D.C. while trying to keep the focus on public health.
In MarketWatch, Paul Brandus said Fauci's advice was always on the mark.
"During the pandemic—which, by the way, is still linked to nearly 500 U.S. deaths a day and shows signs of picking up steam again with the so-called BA.5 subvariant— Fauci came under fierce criticism from armchair Twitter critics and politicians who considered themselves more knowledgeable and experienced on matters of infectious diseases than he was," Brandus said. "For his efforts to help save lives, this dedicated public servant and his family were harassed and targeted with vile and vicious death threats. What a sad commentary on our increasingly sick society—and I don’t mean sick as in the sniffles—that an experienced doctor trying to save lives had to be assigned security guards. All because he gave people the same common sense advice he gave me so many years ago: practice preventive care.
"Wear a mask. Get vaccinated. Social distancing. His critics, often viewing all this through the lens not of medicine but political loyalty, said he was an idiot," Brandus wrote. "I’m sure you can recall reading stories about people who said it was all a hoax—right up to the moment they were intubated. He never backed down. 'You gotta f—ing suck it up,' he told the Washington Post in June. At age 81, he could have retired decades ago. He could have cashed out and made millions in the private sector. But his commitment to keep on trying to make a difference is such that even today, he works 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week. This energizer bunny of a man simply has never slowed down... And yet there are those among us who have bought into the fake news claptrap that government workers are a bunch of lazy good-for-nothings."
In CNBC, Dawn Kopecki celebrated Fauci's legacy.
"Fauci has become a household fixture during the Covid-19 pandemic, battling back misinformation — sometimes from the highest levels of government," she wrote. "His steadfast commitment to science, challenging former President Donald Trump on everything from the use of hydroxychloroquine to mask mandates, made him a quasi-celebrity in the process. The 81-year-old has advised seven U.S. presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan through the HIV/AIDS epidemic, West Nile virus, the 2001 anthrax attacks, pandemic influenza, various bird influenza threats, Ebola, Zika and, most recently, Covid and monkeypox.
"He first joined the National Institutes of Salud in 1968 at age 27 where he quickly rose through the ranks and eventually took over as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984. Former President George W. Bush awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008... During his tenure, Fauci never shied away from conflict. His Senate hearings were often peppered with terse exchanges with members of Congress, particularly with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who he once accused of inciting death threats against him and his family," she wrote. "At the height of the pandemic, Fauci was fielding more than 2,000 emails a day and working 24/7 on just three to four hours of sleep a night, he told friends and old colleagues in a trove of emails obtained through public records’ requests by several media outlets."
In CNN, Kent Sepkowitz wrote about what made Fauci a great leader.
"After more than 50 years in public service, I imagine Fauci was tired of all the current Covid-19 noise and death threats as well as the tedious discussions that characterize all bureaucratic jobs, much less the ludicrous accusations that he was cashing in on the pandemic and therefore sought to prolong it," Sepkowitz said. "Though fit as a fiddle, he probably -- as he admitted to The Washington Post recently -- is starting to feel his age. (He'll be 82 in December.) But I doubt strongly he gave up because he was frightened or intimidated. After all, Fauci has spent decades in the public eye and has previously been the recipient of seemingly endless criticism, but nevertheless he has always persisted.
"Fauci's crime, according to a critical piece of the public, appeared to be that he tried to guess what was coming next from a never-seen-before pandemic," Sepkowitz wrote. "When he was wrong, he was accused of misleading the public. Many, it seems, expected Fauci to be a fortuneteller and failed to recognize that all medical experts are tasked with making their best judgment calls when faced with uncertainty. Some of those calls will inevitably turn out to be incorrect. And now, with the pandemic -- maybe -- starting to recede, he has decided to move on. When Covid-19 goes down in the history books, what likely will stick out about Fauci's leadership will be not his intelligence, doggedness and humbling work ethic but rather this: He is a true believer in the importance of improving the public's health, even at personal cost."

What the right is saying.
	•	The right is critical of Fauci, saying he misled the public and got a lot of things wrong.
	•	Many call for investigations into his time leading the Covid-19 pandemic response.
	•	Others hope he simply fades away quietly.
In The Federalist, David Harsanyi said "perhaps no person in American history has done more to harm trust in public health than Anthony Fauci."
"And it’s not merely his aggressive inaccuracy about the Covid pandemic or even his championing of authoritarian policies that created untold damage to American life,” Harsanyi said. “All of that is bad enough. But as Fauci transformed into a political operative, he regularly lied to the American people and led the political suppression of debate. In October of 2020, three scientists — Martin Kulldorff of Harvard, Sunetra Gupta of Oxford, and Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford — released the 'Great Barrington Declaration,' a document that rejected the 'damaging physical and mental health impacts' of Faucian lockdowns for a more focused protection of high-risk populations. In December of 2021, the American Institute for Economic Research obtained emails between Fauci and Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health. In them, we learned that duo had conspired to smear those dissenting scientists.
“And this wasn’t the first time Fauci had conspired with Collins to shut down debate. Another batch of emails revealed that the duo colluded to quash any talk of Covid being man-made and possibly leaked from a Wuhan lab. Anyone who brought up the notion would soon be discredited as a racist and nut — a spreader of disinformation,” he wrote. “In the early days of the pandemic, Fauci kept citing the estimate of 60–70 percent vaccination level for reaching herd immunity. Later, he claimed it would be '70, 75 percent.' And finally, '75, 80, 85 percent.' Fauci later admitted lying about that, as well, because 'polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine.' But don’t worry, none of it ever came to fruition."
In National Review, the editors said "good riddance."
"No doubt, Fauci attracted more than his share of unhinged criticism. But the national media loved to focus on the unhinged conspiracy theorists and garden-variety nutjobs and death threats against Fauci, because it helped discredit the much fairer, much more legitimate questioning of Fauci’s advice and decision-making," the editors said. "One of Fauci’s first pieces of advice during the pandemic was to discourage Americans from wearing masks, declaring in a March 8 interview with 60 Minutes, 'There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better, and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.'
"The problem isn’t that Fauci changed his mind as masks became more widely available; it’s that he never really addressed his previous declarations that they were ineffective — declarations that apparently he didn’t believe," they wrote. "Fauci didn’t create the anti-masking sentiment in American life, but his quick reversal fed the suspicion that wearing masks was more about public perceptions than empirical evidence. Those who were paying close attention noticed that Fauci kept shifting his assessment of the percentage needed to reach herd immunity from the virus... Fauci’s emails suggested he had a symbiotic relationship with adoring reporters. He offered evasive answers about U.S. taxpayer money financing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He offered a full-throated defense of gain-of-function research, which looks a little different in the aftermath of a global pandemic that killed millions."
In The Washington Examiner, Tim Carney said he hopes Fauci will just fade away.
"I’m probably less anti-Fauci than the average conservative. In fact, early on, I publicly defended the guy. I believe celebrity damaged him. I also believe that his constant public proclamations — tainted by politics and calibrated for an infectious-disease specialist rather than for a policymaker or spokesman — harmed the credibility of and respect for the public-health establishment," Carney wrote. "Fauci, if he wants the people’s trust in public health to rebound, should gracefully disappear from the public spotlight. The first thing he should not do is to cash out to industry. I’m sure Pfizer or 3M or GE Healthcare would love to hire Fauci or add him to their board. I’m sure some consulting firm could rake in lucrative clientele if it hired him.
"But going to work for profit-seeking health interests will have three harmful effects," Carney said. "Fauci will cast increased suspicion on his past actions if he takes a high-paying gig from any medical company that profited from his past actions and recommendations. The vaccine or mask manufacturers are the obvious examples here. Fauci will send a message to his successors that there are industry jobs waiting on the other side, which would (at least subconsciously) influence the actions of his successors. Fauci will cast massive suspicion on the actions of his successors, for the two reasons stated above. It’s a free country, and Fauci is free to take whatever job he likes. There’s nothing wrong in itself with getting rich. But, in this case, pursuing his maximum profit is harming the cause to which he has dedicated his career."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
	•	Fauci leaves behind a storied career with some remarkable achievements.
	•	He got a lot of things wrong during the pandemic, and his job is to be right.
	•	His public comments on several important issues have been misleading or outright lies, which demands accountability.
In the interest of fairness, let me start with the positive.
Fauci's career is storied. By any objective measure, working until you're 81 years old and ending your career at "the top" is something to be admired. In the interest of clear-headed thinking, if you remove Covid from the picture, Fauci has undoubtedly had a gargantuan and positive impact on the U.S. and the planet. He was on the front lines of the public health responses to AIDS, anthrax, Zika, and Ebola, and the research and treatments he's led have benefited millions not just in the U.S. but abroad. He managed this under seven different administrations with a huge variety of political views, pressures and environments.
I also don't envy his position. Being the public-facing medical advisor to America is clearly not an easy job. We are, bless our hearts, a rowdy, independent-minded, disobedient bunch. It's in our spirit. Americans don't like being told what to do and never have, doubly so when the instructions create minor or major inconveniences in our lives. Fauci had the unenviable task of delivering those instructions regularly, to hundreds of millions of people who all had the power of the internet at their hands to inquire about his evidence and motives. I would have no interest in a job like that.
Unfortunately for Fauci, great figures are always measured by what they do in their biggest moments. And removing Covid from his legacy is not an option. His failures during the pandemic — along with the relationship between his career and the potential origins of the virus — will also rightly be a lasting part of his legacy.
The obvious mistakes are highlighted above: Fauci misled the public early on about masks because he was concerned that public hoarding of masks would hurt health care workers. Like other experts in his field, he was also slow to realize that the virus was spreading among asymptomatic people, a fact that helped unleash the worst of the pandemic in the first few months. He was wrong about Remdesivir, which he once predicted would be the "standard of care" but is now recommended against by the World Health Organization. He was wrong about it being a "pandemic of the unvaccinated." He was wrong that people who were vaccinated "can feel safe they're not going to get infected." Yes, the scientific consensus changed, but — as Fauci himself somewhat arrogantly noted — Fauci represents science. He is the one who we rely on to get this stuff right.
And, in reflecting on the things he got wrong, his view is that we should have had "much, much more stringent restrictions." Given the incredible toll lockdowns and vaccine mandates had on children's health, mental health, addicts, and the economy, and all for uncertain gains in containing the virus, that kind of self-reflection is a hard pill to swallow. With hindsight, a much more compelling argument could be made that what we should have done was focus almost entirely on isolating and protecting the elderly and immunocompromised, who were (and still are) exponentially more at risk from Covid than any other group of Americans.
His reputation as a "straight shooter" has also been repeatedly undermined by his own public comments. He conceded himself that he intentionally misled Americans about the levels of herd immunity America would need to reach in order to drop pandemic restrictions (his numbers changed repeatedly). As The Times put it, "he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks.” This would have been a bigger deal had Fauci not had such a chummy relationship with reporters in the mainstream press, who openly traded kid glove reporting for access.
In front of Congress, he was evasive and misleading about gain-of-function research in Wuhan, which he has supported and driven funding to. Fauci has repeatedly denied that this research, which makes viruses more pathogenic or transmissible in order to study them, was happening at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. While there is still no link between that research and the Covid-19 outbreak, he either doesn't know what is happening at organizations he leads or was lying under oath about the research taking place. There really is no other option. The Intercept, who produced documents proving this research took place, had to sue to get those documents.
Of course, it's not just what Fauci did, but also what he didn't do. He didn't spend nearly enough time reassuring parents that their kids were incredibly unlikely to get seriously ill. He didn't push for schools to open sooner when it became increasingly clear that doing so would be safe and manageable. He didn't combat absurd restrictions on outdoor life even though outdoor transmission almost never happens (a year into the pandemic, I got a ticket for walking by myself down a beach in Los Angeles without a mask). He didn’t treat people who had had the virus similarly to those who had been vaccinated, despite well-established evidence that their immunity levels were similar.
I'm no epidemiologist, but the sum total of the pandemic — the response to which Fauci led — seems like we basically got the worst of both worlds: economic collapse and a deadly pandemic. Widespread restrictions, massive death tolls, economic damage, a far more divided country, and untold collateral damage from those restrictions. It's impossible to say how much of this was truly avoidable or even what a best-case scenario could have been, but I think it's fair to say Fauci's failings were numerous, his public-facing comments were not always forthcoming, and the outcomes were abysmal. None of that is one person’s fault, but Fauci’s role in guiding us through the pandemic was critically important, and it has been a rough ride.

Midterm recap.
Midterm elections took place in Florida, New York and Oklahoma yesterday.
As Axios put it, the story of the night appears to be the success of mainstream candidates on both sides. Both the progressive and Trump-esque candidates running in House races failed in near total fashion.
In New York, Republican Rep. Andrew Garbarino (who voted with Democrats on infrastructure, gay marriage and the Jan. 6 committee) held off a challenge from the right. Nick Langworthy, the state GOP chair, defeated Carl Paladino. In Florida, Republican Rep. Daniel Webster beat Laura Loomer, while Cory Mills defeated Rep. Anthony Sabatini, who had called for arresting FBI agents. None of the four victors had endorsements from Trump.
On the Democratic side, DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney easily beat his progressive challenger Alessandra Biaggi. Dan Goldman, who became well-known for his role in Trump's impeachment, prevailed over a field of progressive challengers, including Rep. Mondaire Jones.
Rep. Max Rose beat progressive activist Brittany Debarros. Finally, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) defeated longtime friend and colleague Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) after the two were drawn into the same district. Maloney was in Congress for 29 years.
One exception: Maxwell Frost, a Bernie Sanders-endorsed 25-year-old, won the primary in Florida's 10th district and looks primed to become the first member of Congress from Gen Z.
Other notes: In a highly watched Hudson Valley swing district special election, Democrat Pat Ryan upset his Republican opponent Marc Molinaro, sparking more commentary about Democrats’ midterm momentum.
Rep. Val Demings (D-FL), a former police chief, won her Democratic nomination and will face Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) for his Senate seat. Former Republican-governor-now-Democrat Charlie Crist (D-FL) won his primary to challenge Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R) won Tuesday's GOP primary runoff, making him the likely replacement of Sen. Jim Inhofe (R) who is retiring after 30 years in office. Mullin, who was endorsed by Trump, will serve the remaining four years of Inhofe's term if he defeats former Democratic congresswoman Kendra Horn.
Madison Horn, who is not related to Kendra, won the Democratic primary for Oklahoma's other Senate seat, and will face sitting Sen. James Lankford (R) in November. Republican Josh Breecheen defeated state Rep. Avery Frix to win the Republican nomination for Oklahoma's 2nd Congressional District.

Under the radar. 
Laid off workers in today's job market are running into a unique dynamic: The ease with which many are finding new jobs. Companies across major sectors have been announcing mass layoffs due to inflation, cooling demand and rising interest rates, but the employees they are firing appear to be getting rehired pretty quickly — keeping jobless numbers very low. Labor demand is historically high, with two job openings for every one unemployed person seeking work. The data reflects this trend: While jobless claims are ticking up, continuing claims — which measures people claiming ongoing job benefits — are rising at a much slower rate. The Wall Street Journal has the story.

Numbers. 
	•	3.8%. The margin of victory for Democrat Pat Ryan in the special election in New York's 19th district, widely considered a bellwether for the 2022 midterms.
	•	1.5%. President Biden's margin of victory in New York's 19th district in 2020.
	•	12%. The percentage by which women have outpaced men in new voting registration in Pennsylvania since Roe v. Wade fell.
	•	46%. The percentage of voters who strongly or somewhat support extending student payment suspensions, according to Morning Consult.
	•	41%. The percentage of voters who strongly or somewhat oppose extending student payment suspensions, according to Morning Consult.
	•	13%. The percentage of voters who don't know or have no opinion, according to Morning Consult.
	•	59%. The percentage of Americans who are worried canceling student loan debt will make inflation worse, according to CNBC.

Have a nice day.
Pennsylvania woman Peggy Koller is 99 years old. That may sound like a lot, but her number of years on this planet is actually one fewer than the number of great-grandchildren she now has. Koller, an only child, recently made headlines for meeting her 100th great-grandchild. Koller got married and had 11 children. Then came 56 grandchildren. And now, the 99-year-old has 100 great-grandkids. She said being an only child was lonely so she always wanted a big family, and it's tough to argue she didn't accomplish that. Lucky 100's name? Koller William Balster, after her now legendary great-grandmother. ABC7 has the story.

MBA PROGRAM OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS

 
Dear Bryant,
Hello from the Yale School of Management. I’m back again with more application advice, this time about the academic profile. One of the main things the Admissions Committee is assessing in your MBA application is your preparation for the Yale SOM classroom. We make this assessment by looking at a combination of application elements, most notably your undergraduate (and, if applicable, graduate school) transcripts and your standardized test scores, as well as to a lesser extent our Behavioral Assessment.
If you are applying in Round 1, you likely have at least scheduled your GMAT or GRE at this point and have spent some time preparing for the exam. So you are already far down the path of taking the test. Similarly, unless you are a current college senior applying as a Silver Scholar, your undergraduate degree is complete and your grades are already in place. Therefore, instead of offering tips on how to prepare for these components, I’d like to spend some time explaining how the Admissions Committee looks at your academic profile, and also speak a little about the Behavioral Assessment, a unique feature of the Yale SOM application.
Read on for my thoughts and register to attend an Admissions Q&A to get your questions answered by one of our Admissions Officers. 
Your Academic Profile 
Your undergraduate record and standardized test scores are both strong predictors of your performance in the MBA classroom, but they are just two data points and they do not exist in isolation. We take what is commonly called a “holistic” approach to candidate evaluation, which means that we look at all application inputs in combination and don’t assign a fixed weight to any element.
That's one reason why, for example, we encourage applicants to focus less on our median GMAT or GRE score and look instead at the range of scores that comprise each class. The test score is not one-size-fits-all; it has different meaning depending on the rest of your application, so don’t feel as though you need to be at or above the median (by definition, half of our students aren’t!).
Similarly, when evaluating your academic history, we look at far more than just your overall GPA. The Admissions Committee will spend a good deal of time going semester-by-semester, looking at each of the courses you’ve taken and your performance in them. We also look at your major, your institution, the range of courses you’ve taken, and any trends in your performance. Your story is much more than just a GPA.
These examples I hope give some sense of the nuance with which we look at your academic background and preparation. We’ve learned a great deal over the years that has helped us refine our evaluation process. Two quick examples: First, although we care about your quantitative preparation for our program (and that’s an example of where we look at your test score and coursework in tandem to evaluate your overall level of preparation), the verbal section of the standardized test is actually more predictive of performance in our MBA program than the quantitative section; and second, when evaluating transcripts, how well you performed in college is much more predictive than where you went to school, which may be why in each MBA class of roughly 350 students, well over 200 different undergraduate institutions are represented.
In evaluating your quantitative preparation specifically, we look at your exposure to a number of different courses such as calculus, statistics, microeconomics, finance, and accounting. Successful applicants do not need to have taken all of those courses, and some have not taken any of them. But if you haven’t taken statistics and microeconomics, I would suggest doing so before starting an MBA program – ours or any other. Not only can it help in the admissions process, but it will help you in the program itself, where data-driven decision-making is a core competency and microeconomics is a common language. Also, in terms of standardized tests, applicants often ask whether we have a preference between the GMAT and GRE. We don't. I hope you will sit for whichever exam you are most comfortable. 
Finally, I would note that in addition to your test scores and transcripts, we have another data point that aids the Admissions Committee in our evaluation and that is one of the most unique features of the Yale SOM application. After submitting your application, all applicants complete our Behavioral Assessment, a non-cognitive instrument that measures a set of intra- and interpersonal competencies related to success in business school. The Behavioral Assessment consists of 120 paired statements, and you choose which of the two statements most describes you. It takes roughly 20-30 minutes to complete and there are no right or wrong answers, so there is nothing you need to do to prepare for it. I think it’s important to understand that we introduced this assessment as a way to better predict academic success for applicants who may not demonstrate academic preparation based on traditional metrics such as grades and scores but who would make strong contributions to the classroom. The Behavioral Assessment is meant to offer more information and give the Admissions Committee a fuller picture of each applicant. It won't be a deciding factor in any application – we use it with a light touch, as we like to say – but it does help us broaden the scope of our evaluation and expand the range of candidates whom we can admit, which we feel is an important goal.
Best Regards,
Bruce DelMonico

Based on your usage breakdown, here are a few tips:
  
Keep lamps and appliances away from thermostats
Electronic devices emit heat that can cause the air conditioner to run longer than necessary.

MORE IDEAS 
  
Use an electric kettle
An electric kettle uses less electricity than a pot on the stove. Plus, the water level indicator helps you boil only as much water as needed.

MORE IDEAS 
  
Consider replacing your old cookware
Flat-bottomed cookware allows for more contact with heating elements. A warped-bottom pot can take 50% more energy to boil the same amount of water!

After you arrive
Every traveller has obligations to follow specific measures under the Quarantine Act and its Emergency Orders to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 and variants in Canada.
Arrival testing
	•	On arrival to Canada, you may be required to take a COVID-19 arrival test. Air travellers are asked to register an account in advance for your COVID-19 test. Pre-registration with the test provider will speed up your testing experience.

Public Health measures
Unless you are instructed differently by a screening officer, the mandatory measures under the Quarantine Act and its Emergency Orders applicable to you and other travellers in your group include:
	•	Fully vaccinated travellers without symptoms: You do not need to quarantine unless you were selected for arrival testing and subsequently tested positive (see above information on arrival testing).
	•	Medically-exempt travellers without symptoms: See instructions in the information handout For travellers over 12 without symptoms who have a medical contraindication against receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
	•	Travellers with symptoms, a positive test result within the last 10 days or who are not fully vaccinated: Go directly to your suitable place and quarantine or isolate as instructed in the information handout COVID-19: For travellers with symptoms, a positive test, who aren't fully vaccinated without symptoms, or who don't have a fully vaccinated exemption.

Hi All, 

Please see this invitation from the Stake, if you did not receive it already. 

Best, 
Brother Hulme 


 
From: Robin Wright <noreply-lcr@churchofjesuschrist.org>  Sent: Thursday, August 18, 2022 8:58 AM To: brentmwight@gmail.com Subject: Self Reliance / Welfare Training
 
 
American Fork Utah South Stake 
My good brothers and sisters. Please see the invitation to join in, via zoom, on some wonderful training on Self Reliance and Welfare. As you serve the good members of our Stake these resources will be a great guide and stay for those who may have some specific and special needs. In your leadership callings, you have great opportunities to help love and direct those in need. These times are when we truly get to serve in loving ways, just as the Savior would. 
We encourage you to make the time be involved in this wonderful opportunity. These training sessions will take place on a quarterly basis, with different scenarios each time. I know this will help us all as we serve our fellow brothers and sisters.
Please make the time to take advantage of this great training. Please see below how to register in advance to join in this Zoom training session. See the attached file with the Scenarios that will be covered.
***
If you have not already, we kindly invite you to share this invitation with your leaders. With the endorsement of Elder Matthew Clarke, American Fork Area Seventy, EQ and RS presidencies, high councilors, stake RS presidencies, and stake and ward specialists are invited to participate in a scenario-based resources practicum, on Wednesday, August 24, 2022, 7:00–8:30PM. If needed, bishoprics may also participate.
 
The practicum will be held via Zoom. Register in advance, here: https://churchofjesuschrist.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwqc-GpqzsuHNCwRwIkD8kksfjrQOUlfH0I. After registering, a link will be sent to join the meeting. 
 
The expected outcome for participants in this American Fork/Lehi Area leader practicum is increased confidence and competence in ministering to and caring for those in need. Participants will gather in breakout groups to engage realistic scenarios, learning together how to access and apply Church and community resources to assist members with life’s challenges. Resource experts will be on the call to assist.

Hey Wayne,

It looks like that is still showing up as a 0 on my end. Can you fix that?

It also appears that my team evaluation never got submitted. That's an easy 10 points I should have credit for after all the hard work we put into the team project. Attached is my evaluation. Please let me know if you can change those two scores or if I'll have to email the professor.

Thanks,

I wasn't able to attend one of her group sessions, but I set something up with her individually and she told me that she would make sure to let you guys know that I attended so I could get full points. 

Hopefully she sent that to you, if not I have emails with her before the assignment was due to show our conversation.

Thanks,

Free Relationship Workshop
 
Sex, Intimacy & Infertility﻿
 
 
 
Infertility is more common than most people think. According to the CDC, approximately 1 in 5 (19%) couples are unable to get pregnant after one year of trying to conceive. What’s more, infertility is expected to increase in the future. By 2025, almost 10 million couples are expected to encounter problems in having a baby. Unfortunately, most couples are completely unprepared for the physical, psychological, social, and sexual impact that infertility challenges bring into a relationship.
 
In this presentation you will:
	•	Learn what infertility is and the causes of infertility
	•	Know how men and women experience infertility differently and the challenges these differences have on relationships
	•	Understand the psychological and social impact of the infertility
	•	Learn about the impact of infertility on sexual intimacy, practices, and functioning
 
Following her presentation, Emily will hold a 15-20 anonymous Q&A session!
 
This webinar is approved for 1 CEU by the Utah Association for Marriage and Family Therapy
 
After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.

Subject: Fall Semester at BYU: 4 Things to Know & 3 Things to Do
Date: August 17, 2022 at 6:29:42 AM MDT
To: <bryant0918@gmail.com>
Reply-To: BYU University Communications <univ-comm@byu.edu>


Fall semester is less than two weeks away. This is your 2x-a-month(ish) email bringing you the stuff you want and need to know, like deadlines, announcements and happenings on campus. It'll be short and to the point, with easy-to-read details and links to find out more. 

Four Things to Know. 
1. Your BYU ID will get you free UTA rides. As a registered student, you can use your BYU ID to ride local and express buses, UVX, FrontRunner and TRAX for FREE. Just remember to have a physical ID with you to "tap on and off" your vehicle of choice.  
  
2. Academic Dates + Deadlines
	•	Summer Term Grades Online: M, Aug 22
	•	New Student Orientation Begins: Th, Aug 25
	•	First Day of Fall Semester Classes: M, Aug 29
3. A new healthcare leadership minor is now available. This new minor will be open to all students and will offer an overview of the business aspects of healthcare. Covered topics include healthcare finance, information systems, government regulation and more. 
  
4. The walkway between Helaman Halls and the Tanner Building is under construction this semester. You may need to find a new route or leave a little early to make it to your class on time. Got to get your steps in though, right? 

Three Things to Do. 
  
1. Become the next Student Innovator of the Year. Do you have a great idea? This competition is your opportunity to get your prototype and research funded, along with a chance to win prize money. Come to the kickoff on W, Sep 7, from 6–7 p.m. at the Engineering Building. 
2. Check out the fall devotional schedule. Devotionals are a unique part of the BYU experience. Come join other students each Tuesday at 11:05 a.m. in the Marriott Center to receive spiritual and temporal edification from BYU employees and leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  
  
3. Audition to be in a choir, jazz ensemble or orchestra. Were you born to sing? Or are you a natural violinist? Now is your chance to join one of the performing arts groups here on campus. Auditions for choirs and ensembles begin in the next two weeks. 

One Thing to Watch. 
  
1. BYU Vocal Point performs "I See the Light" (from "Tangled"). Check out Vocal Point's newest collab with Broadway's original "Cinderella" Laura Osnes and the All-American Boys Chorus.

MBA PROGRAM OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS

 
Dear Bryant,
Hello from the Yale School of Management. Welcome to the first installment of our Inbox Application Insights series, where we deliver application advice to you as you need it in the month leading up to our September 13 Round 1 application deadline.
Today I would like to talk about our one required essay question: describe the biggest commitment you have ever made. When you hear that topic, it may well be that there’s one idea that immediately comes to mind. If so, go with that idea. As with many decisions in life, your first instinct is likely your best one. If, by contrast, you think of a few different ideas and are struggling to decide which one to use, my advice is to trust your gut and go with the one that seems most significant to you. Again, as with many decisions in life, don’t overthink it.  
I’ll explain more below, but before you read on, don't forget to register for tomorrow's Our Best Application Advice: The Event Formerly Known as The Application Tips Panel to get additional application advice from Assistant Deans Bruce DelMonico (me) and Laurel Grodman.
Essay Tips
My first insight here is that in reading your essay, the Admissions Committee is not making value judgments about what commitment you choose. You don’t need to labor over which of several commitments you feel we’ll find most worthy – the key is not which commitment you think we’ll think is the best, but which is the most significant to you.
Know that there is no one right or wrong essay topic; we receive outstanding, insightful essays covering a wide range of topics. Of particular note, we have just as many applicants who write about personal commitments as about professional ones. We do not valorize one kind of commitment over the other. Rather, regardless of what commitment you choose, the most important aspect of the essay is to describe in detail the behaviors that demonstrate that commitment. 
The essay question evolved from conversations with Amy Wrzesniewski, Michael H. Jordan Professor of Management, who noted, “Reading about future plans is helpful, but actions speak louder than words.” Yale SOM students are impact-oriented and have a bias toward action, so in your essay response, we are looking to learn about how you supported the commitment you chose. Point to the specific actions that you have taken over time to bolster your commitment. Don’t just explain why a commitment is important to you; we want to understand how your behaviors have furthered your commitment.
I would also note that you do not need to connect your essay to the MBA degree – you don’t need to explain how the commitment supports why you want to get an MBA, either in general or at Yale. We ask those questions elsewhere in the application process, so don’t spend your limited words on those topics here. And of course, as always, remember to proofread!  
Best regards,
Bruce DelMonico
Assistant Dean for Admissions

Rockwell Ranch community member,
Our apologies for some miscommunication regarding the ‘pavilion’ area near the pool. This area is NOT complete, but should be done and ready to enjoy soon. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.
 We are also in need of TWO onsite owners who are available and willing to share in a security check of the building each night, keep an eye on the clubhouse/pool areas, and take to curb and return the garbage totes for the clubhouse each week. This scope of responsibility would be split between the two individuals (15 days each, even or odd days) at a compensated rate of $75 per person/per month, rain or shine, 365 a year (or 182, as the case may be).
 If you are an onsite owner who is interested in this paid duty, please follow these instructions:
*Email Carolee at caroleep@amres.co (not .com) with your NAME/ADDRESS and which Rockwell Ranch sub-association you are a member of (Single, Town, or Condo).  You will be required to sign a non-employee waiver, provide a completed W9, and perform the duties listed above to be considered. Depending on how many members are interested, a drawing may be the method in selecting the two owners who will be paid for these services.

Sincerely, 
Advantage Management and Real Estate Services on behalf of ROCKWELL RANCH TOWNHOME OWNERS ASSOCIATION INC (801) 235-7368 | amres.co

If you would like to respond to this notification, please place your response above the dotted line. 


Rockwell Ranch community member,
Please see details below regarding the Rockwell Ranch Master Association and its amenities.
 PAVILION: The pavilion area to the northeast of the pool is up and a great place to meet friends and family. This area in non-reservable and available on a first come/first served basis. Please be careful and conscientious with food in this area and take with you all garbage or place in the on the backside of the clubhouse near the pool front gate.
 PICKLEBALL COURT:  The pickleball court is painted and ready for your use. This is for Rockwell Ranch residents ONLY and is key fob activated to protect this area from use from non-residents. The hours of operation are from 7 AM – 10 PM 7 days a week and all fobs are automatically activated for usage during these times. No food or drink is permitted inside of the court gates and no scooters, skateboards, bikes, trikes, rollerblades, or the like is allowed inside the court.
 CLUBHOUSE RESERVATIONS: The interactive calendar and Clubhouse Reservation access link is almost ready to go. Look for an email in the near future with the needed information to make a reservation for the Facility in the future. These will be available on a first come/first served basis in four (4) hour blocks of time up to three times daily. Stay tuned.
 POOL: As a follow-up on the pool usage/opening, this is still delayed. Keystone (the Developer of the Rockwell Ranch communities) is working diligently and directly with American Fork City and the Utah County Health Department on behalf of the Rockwell Ranch communities to expedite the certificate of occupancy/usage for the pool. This has been an arduous experience as several parties are involved and delays from entities complicating what was expected to be quite simple. In hindsight, we should have waited to announce the pool and key fob distribution to owners until all requirements and permits were in place. We do understand the disappointment and frustration for owners who only see a pool that looks ready to use, but not understand the bureaucracy of receiving a permit for public use.
 As a result of this delay, Keystone Development will cover all costs for the current 2022 pool expenses of chlorine, testing, heating, and cleaning for the while waiting in a holding pattern for the final permit to be issued. All funds that have been collected on behalf of the Rockwell Ranch Master, stay in that operating fund, and will help offset future costs and budgeted projections for pool operation. In speculated anticipation, we hope for Keystone to receive the final approval for usage soon. Once this has been achieved, notice will be sent to all owners for an opening date, usage times, and pool rules for safety and caring of the community amenity.
 POOL RULES: Rules regarding the usage and conduct at the pool can be found on the Rockwell Ranch Master Association website at https://portal.amres.co/Home_v2/Documents
**As a reminder, to pick up your key fob you can visit the Advantage Management office in Orem at 460 E. 800 N. (M-Th 9 AM to 5 PM). We recommend you have an appointment first to verify that you are in the system and that a key fob has been activated in your name before you make the trip. There is ONE key fob issued per property/owner, and you must produce photo ID to receive your fob. Please keep track of your owner specific fob as replacement fobs are $50. with the same requirements of owner or written permission (lease must be on file). *If you lease your unit, we must have a copy of your lease on file as required in your CCRs, as well as an offsite address to issue a fob to your tenant. Your tenant must have written permission to pick up the fob on your behalf (email permission is sufficient). Replacement fobs are $50. Please submit a copy of your lease to your specific HOA to be saved to file. The following information is required when submitting a copy of your lease: name, HOA property address, email, phone number, and OFFSITE mailing address. **

ACME Seniors, 

You are invited to join us for the ACME Senior Reboot Aug 26-27.  There will be Pizza at lunch time and you can get a head start on your labs (Pandas and Wordle), meet the incoming Juniors, and just hang out with all of your ACME friends again and maybe play a little 4-square.   For the juniors we are calling this bootcamp but for the seniors it's more of a reunion or a reboot to get you back into the swing of things. 

Senior reboot hours will be held from 9 am to 5 pm on Friday, August 26th and 10 am to 4 pm on Saturday, August 27th in 150 and 149 TMCB.  Attendance is flexible--feel free to arrive and leave at your convenience--but we do need to know how much food to order, so be sure to RSVP here: https://forms.gle/3hLCLyUomNgQTaz59.

Seniors,

Many of you are thinking of going to graduate school next year.  You should remember that the GRE math subject test is required by many programs for admission, and the deadline to sign up to take the test is tomorrow, AUG 12.

I have been told that the closest center where you can take it is at Utah State and they don't offer the test online like they do with the general GRE. They are offering tests on September 17th and October 29th. The deadline for registration for the September test is tomorrow (August 12th) and August 19th is the late registration deadline. The registration deadline for October 29th is September 23rd.

ACME seniors:

I have one more supplemental problem to add to the numpy lab that should help you better appreciate the power of NumPy.  It should be fast to do, but very enlightening.

Given this code:
def np_cosine(X):
    return np.cos(X)
   
def naive_cosine(X):
    for i in range(n):
        X[i] = np.cos(X[i])
    return X

n = 10**6
A = np.random.randn(n)  
Do the following 
	•	print the first 5 values of A 
	•	Time the computation np_cosine(A)  
	•	print the first five values of A 
	•	Time the computation naive_cosine(A)  
	•	Which is faster?  How many times faster? 
	•	Print the first five values of A  Compare to the other printouts of the first five values and explain what happened. 
	•	Make a new version of  naive_cosine called better_cosine that doesn’t change the value of its input. Compare how fast it runs vs  naive_cosine 
	•	set B = A.reshape(10**3,10**3) 
	•	Write a function max_row that uses a for-loop to iterate through the rows of B and returns the max of each row without using any NumPy functions (ok to use the python builtin function max). 
	•	Make sure max_row gives the same answers as np.max(B,axis=1) 
	•	Compare the time it takes for maxrow to run versus the time it takes to run the NumPy function np.max(B,axis=1) 
	•	Vow that you will never again use a for-loop if a NumPy function can be used instead. 

Enjoy!

One thing that we have noticed is that we all could use a little bit of a NumPy refresher.  It's just so powerful we could have many, many labs devoted only to NumPy.  This year we have decided to provide a bonus lab for you to do that will be due  September 6.  If you complete this lab you will have the opportunity to have one additional soft grade at the end of the semester.  

Now, this lab is new so despite all our best efforts, there may be some bugs.  Put any you find on slack and we will respond as quickly as possible to your questions/issues.

Quick hits.
	1.	Federal agents carried out an unannounced search warrant on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence yesterday. Trump said in a statement that the agents broke open a safe, and news reports indicate the search was tied to classified documents he allegedly took from the White House. (The search) 
	2.	Travis and Gregory McMichael were sentenced to life in prison for the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. They had been found guilty of federal hate crime charges, and already faced life sentences on state murder charges. (The sentence)
	3.	The U.S. announced it was sending $1 billion in rockets, ammunition and other material to Ukraine from Defense Department stockpiles. It's the largest arms delivery yet, bringing the total investment in the war to $9 billion. (The money) 
	4.	Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin will hold primary elections today. (The races) 
	5.	In his first official trip since recovering from Covid-19, President Biden toured eastern Kentucky after a series of floods, promising to allocate federal resources to families whose homes had been lost or damaged. (The visit)

Today's topic.
Monkeypox. On Thursday, the federal government declared monkeypox a public health emergency. The declaration was made in an attempt to allocate more resources to the outbreak, which has already infected over 7,100 Americans. The announcement will free up money and other resources to fight the virus.
Reminder: Monkeypox is a virus that closely resembles smallpox, and was first detected in monkeys in 1958 before spreading to humans in 1970. It causes fever, body aches, chills, fatigue and a pimple-like bumpy rash across the body. It spreads primarily through prolonged skin-to-skin contact (like hugging, cuddling and kissing), as well as through shared bedding, towels and clothes. This outbreak has primarily spread among men who have sex with men, but health officials have emphasized the virus can infect anyone who comes into contact with an infected person.
Until this year, most reported cases of the virus were in Africa. A monkeypox epidemic has persisted in Nigeria since 2017. So far, nobody in the U.S. has died from the virus, though this outbreak has killed at least 10 people globally.
A vaccine for monkeypox already exists, and the White House has said it has made 1.1 million doses available and has boosted domestic diagnostic capacity to 80,000 tests per week. However, unlike some standard vaccines, the two-dose shot is currently being given 28 days apart after exposure, as a measure to prevent or reduce symptoms. In large cities like New York and San Francisco, clinics have said they don't have enough of the two-shot vaccine to meet demand. Many health officials at the city level have criticized the White House for a slow response.
Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University, told the Associated Press the federal government has been too cautious and should have declared an emergency sooner.
“It is a textbook case of a public health emergency,” Gostin said. “It’s not a red or a blue state issue. There is no political opposition to fighting monkeypox.”
It's not just the U.S. ringing the alarm bell. The World Health organization called monkeypox a public health emergency, citing cases in over 70 countries.
Below, we'll take a look at some arguments from the left and right about the declaration and the Biden administration's response.

Agreed. 
Figures on both the left and right have been critical of the government's response and the Biden administration's failure to declare a public emergency in a more timely fashion. Many also criticize public health officials for not communicating clearly enough the prevalence of the virus among gay men.

What the left is saying.
	•	The left is critical of the Biden administration's slow response.
	•	Many wonder why the U.S. seems uniquely bad at handling public health emergencies.
	•	Others say the administration should be clearer about the concentrated impact within the LGBTQ community.
In The Washington Post, Kartina vanden Heuvel said this is the latest example that the U.S. is bad at handling pandemics.
"Once again, the United States is unprepared to keep an emerging virus at bay — and just as unprepared to talk about it. As we’ve learned that monkeypox disproportionately affects men who have sex with other men, we’ve seen homophobic conspiracy theories spread almost more quickly than the virus itself," she wrote. "Right-wing ideologues, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-Ga.), have falsely labeled monkeypox a sexually transmitted infection — even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that sex is just one way the virus spreads. Worse, presented with the fact that some young people have contracted the disease, conspiracists are spreading the heinous fiction that gay men are 'grooming' children. Meanwhile, not nearly enough vaccines are being distributed, and CDC officials haven’t always clearly communicated who is most at risk and how they can be protected.
"These intertwined failures of messaging and policy raise the question: Does the U.S. have epidemic amnesia? The monkeypox response is following an eerily familiar pattern: Viruses begin in a vulnerable population that people in power don’t feel is worthy of their attention and care," vanden Heuvel added. "Infected people are stigmatized and their suffering is ignored, allowing the virus to spread. Then, only once it’s affecting broader populations — and thus impossible to contain — do those in power take action... Two and a half years into a pandemic, we know the basic steps needed to stop monkeypox’s spread: Make testing and vaccination easy, accessible and free. Allow those infected to properly isolate — monkeypox requires a full three weeks of isolation to prevent spread — by offering financial assistance to those forced to stay home. And, to ensure that at-risk people can take precautions and seek care, message with empathy, urgency and honesty."
In The Los Angeles Times, Wendy Orent said the scandal of monkeypox is that a worldwide outbreak happened at all.
"That monkeypox is spreading rapidly is undeniable," Orent wrote. "While monkeypox isn’t at this point a truly sexually transmitted disease like gonorrhea or syphilis, sexual contact has driven this outbreak. Monkeypox spreads through intimate physical contact, including direct contact with monkeypox pustules loaded with virus. People may not realize that their malaise is monkeypox in its early phase. Although anyone touching an infected person or their sheets, clothing and towels could theoretically catch monkeypox, the highest risk remains in concentrated networks of friends, companions and lovers.
"That means the public health response should focus on those networks, who are most at risk and so need the most protection," Orent said. "According to a recent World Health Organization report, about 99% of cases outside Africa have been in men and 95% involve men who have sex with other men. Gay men and LGBTQ communities especially need clear guidelines about how to recognize early symptoms — headaches, swollen glands, fever, sore throat — as well as ready access to vaccines, antivirals and, crucially, government benefits allowing them to isolate at home until they’re well... We have for years had the capacity to vaccinate those most at risk via two doses of Jynneos, the safer, updated version of the old smallpox vaccine. But we haven’t done so, and now the virus has reached the Western world. Now millions of doses have been ordered for the U.S. alone — and none yet for Africa."
In Common Dreams, Jacob Carter wrote about the Biden administration's slow response.
"The Biden administration’s response to the monkeypox virus hasn’t been well-received by experts or by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer, and Transgender (LGBQT) community," Carter wrote. "When cases began rising, the administration was criticized by LGBQT activists for not moving fast enough to secure the effective Jynneos monkeypox vaccine to slow, and potentially halt, the spread of the virus in the United States. The New York Times reported in July that the US government took a 'wait-and-see' approach. For weeks while it was known that monkeypox was spreading, the administration let some 300,000 US-owned doses of ready-to-use Jynneos vaccine sit still in cold storage in Denmark, where the producer of the vaccine, Bavarian Nordic, is located.
"The administration’s monkeypox response team will not only have to work past the prior fumbles in acquiring the vaccine, but also will face obstacles in deploying it," Carter said. "One of those obstacles will be in how the team navigates its messaging to avoid stigmatizing the LGBQT community. Already, homophobic politicians, right-wing pundits, and other public figures are targeting and blaming the LGBQT community for the spread of monkeypox, leading to stigmatization and discrimination of gay and bisexual men in particular, which is reminiscent of public health mistakes made during the HIV/AIDS crisis... the stigma generated by this hate has very real repercussions on the health of everyone. Infected people who may not want to be open about their sex lives are less likely to seek treatment or vaccinate themselves, which inevitably makes controlling the monkeypox outbreak more difficult."

What the right is saying. 
	•	The right is also critical of the Biden administration, saying the characteristics of the virus should have made it easy to control.
	•	Some criticized the inexperience of Biden's top health officials.
	•	Others said fears of offending the LGTBQ community has hampered the Biden administration's response.
In City Journal, Joel Zinberg said the features of monkeypox should make it easy to control — but this administration failed.
"Monkeypox is less severe and transmissible than Covid-19," Zinberg said. "It spreads through intimate contact, primarily skin-to-skin. Respiratory transmission is far less common and requires prolonged face-to-face contact. Unlike Covid-19, which can spread before symptoms are apparent, monkeypox is only transmitted after symptoms—rash, fever, lethargy—occur. And, perhaps most important, unlike Covid-19, for which there were no vaccines or treatments during most of the first year of the pandemic, approved vaccines and antivirals exist for monkeypox... [and yet] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention waited until late June to expand monkeypox testing. As a result, through the end of June, the U.S. had tested only 2,009 suspected monkeypox cases. And despite owning 372,000 FDA-approved Danish vaccines, Biden administration officials reportedly left most of the supply in Denmark, ordering only small shipments of vaccines for importation.
"[New York City's] response has not been flawless, either," he added. "Instead of encouraging gay and bisexual men—the population that, to date, accounts for nearly all cases— to change, at least temporarily, their sexual behavior during the outbreak through abstinence or limiting relationships to known partners, the city health department issued an advisory in mid-July suggesting that having sex while infected with monkeypox could be made safer by avoiding kissing and covering sores. Such advice is unrealistic and irresponsible. Health officials were reportedly worried about stigmatizing gay men. Yet such wishy-washy advice is hurting the very people that public officials are afraid of defaming. Officials had to target the gay and bisexual community with information about monkeypox symptoms and access to testing so that they could confirm their infection status and, if positive, avoid sexual contact until their infection clears."
In The Washington Examiner, Tim Carney blamed Health Secretary Xavier Becerra's limited experience.
"How the hell during a pandemic did President Joe Biden name a health secretary with no competence in public health?" Carney asked. "And is anyone surprised that HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra is making the monkeypox outbreak worse? Part of Becerra’s incompetence is his inability to clear away red tape or prioritize anything at a time when we were supposed to have learned something about infectious diseases. Another part is his lame political correctness in talking about a disease that is overwhelmingly spread by men having sex with men... . Becerra (beyond having no competence, experience, or training in public health) can’t fight this fight because he was brought here precisely to be a left-wing culture warrior.
"Becerra met Biden’s standards for health secretary because Becerra is an abortion extremist and a culture warrior who relishes in persecuting religious conservatives," Carney said. "Becerra’s qualification for HHS secretary was pressing a felony prosecution against pro-life activist David Daleiden because Daleiden exposed Planned Parenthood’s trade in the organs of aborted babies. Even the Los Angeles Times called Becerra’s crusade 'a disturbing overreach.'... Xavier Becerra was obviously unqualified to run HHS during the COVID pandemic, and his incompetence is worsening the monkeypox outbreak."
In National Review, Pradheep Shanker called it the "newest failure of public health policy."
"In the U.S., public-health leaders have been reluctant to sound warnings, out of fear of possible backlash against communities hardest hit by the disease — in particular, gay and bisexual men," Shanker wrote. "Discussing the Biden administration’s efforts to stop the spread, White House health-policy adviser Dr. Ashish Jha spoke specifically to this concern. 'I think it’s very clear at this point that the community most affected is the LGBTQ community,' he said. 'It’s really important that we do not use this moment to propagate homophobic or transphobic messaging, and stick to the science.' This is absolutely the right way to walk the fence. It is essential to point out who is being hit hardest by the virus. Communicating to those populations will be essential to getting the disease under control. Meanwhile, it is prudent to be wary of the prejudices that exist in our society, and how those people may abuse the facts in these cases to target at-risk populations for their own ends.
"This is a far cry from others in the health-policy arena. Former Biden White House senior adviser Andy Slavitt, for example, tweeted, 'The myth that sexual activity is the cause of monkeypox & that reducing it is a valid strategy for managing a disease does not, on its face, make any sense.' This was moral preening of the worst order," Shanker said. "The facts are obvious: Right now, monkeypox is mostly infecting gay and bisexual men. This isn’t opinion; this is fact. Monkeypox traditionally has had no sexual, racial, or cultural predilection. But this current outbreak clearly does, as Dr. Jha admitted. And it is totally reasonable for health professionals to consider that stigma created over describing any illness as being associated with a singular minority group of any kind. But by trying to eliminate the risk of prejudice caused by the evidence in this case, health-policy experts are prioritizing fighting the social ills of prejudice and hate over focusing on stopping the virus."

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write in. If you're a paying subscriber, you can also leave a comment.
First of all, I think it's worth stating plainly that this is not Covid. Obviously, on the heels of a pandemic that has already killed over six million people and upended so many of our lives, reaching for comparisons is the knee-jerk reaction. But it's worth remembering where we are: We're talking about 7,000 cases and zero deaths on U.S. soil, with just a handful of deaths globally. That doesn't mean this isn't a big deal — it is — it just means it's not prudent to talk about this as if it's Covid 2.0. It is not.
One insight that I do think is worth remembering is just how difficult it is to manage pandemics and disease spread in the U.S. In this newsletter, specifically, I often defended former President Trump and his administration's response to Covid-19. Yes, Trump said a lot of dumb things about Covid, and made deeply erroneous predictions about what the outcomes would be, which almost certainly contributed to the U.S. having some of the worst outcomes (statistically, in terms of cases and deaths) of any nation on earth.
But I was always skeptical of the standard talking point from the left about what would have happened if Biden, Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton were in the White House. Mostly because, if you zoomed out, you could see how other nations and world leaders also struggled so much with Covid-19. The list of global leaders who navigated the crisis deftly is extraordinarily short, and typically came at major costs to the economy and the freedom of their citizens.
Now, though, the Biden administration's response to monkeypox is affirmation of just how broken our system is, regardless of who is in the White House. Given everything we just learned from Covid, and given the general outlines of monkeypox (we have a vaccine, it spreads through extremely close contact, and it spreads after obvious symptom onset) controlling this outbreak should have been a slam dunk. I don't mean to be blithe, but this was the figurative lay-up of pandemics, and so far the administration has botched it.
Part of that failure has been the cultural element. The virus is prevalent among gay and bisexual men, which has created a tightrope to walk for public health officials who need to speak clearly and honestly about at-risk communities and also not create fear or indignation toward those communities. I respect the need to walk that tight rope, and there is no doubt some horrific and bigoted talking points are spreading in the media space (Brad Polumbo, a Libertarian writer who is also gay, responded directly to some of those talking points here). But at the same time, I abhor the folks openly disregarding the reality of this outbreak in order to avoid any perceived offense.
The distinction seems obvious enough to me: the virus monkeypox can and does effect anyone, but this outbreak is currently happening among men who are sexually active with other men.
The other part of this failure is a more run-of-the-mill, administrative, typical government botched job. The New York Times did damning reporting on the Biden administration's "wait-and-see" approach, calling for more vaccines only after cases were growing exponentially (when that growth was expected and predicted). 300,000 of those vaccines, as many writers noted above, were readily available, owned by the U.S., and sitting in a facility in Denmark.
At the top of the administration, of course, is the president — so some blame does ultimately fall with Biden. But the blame should more directly be pinned on the people leading the CDC, the public health officials in New York and other major cities, and the top-down administrative incompetence.
For all the talk of what we learned and how much better prepared we are for the "next Covid," this first test run is anything but encouraging. We're lucky, frankly, that we're dealing with a much less deadly disease that’s much harder to spread than any of the dozens of others out there we could spend our time worrying about. Hopefully, the emergency declaration helps, the administration’s plan gets executed quickly and we ramp up testing and vaccines to the point we can contain this thing — but my optimism is waning.

Your questions, answered. 
Q: I have not paid attention to politics at all until the past few years. I’ve been really puzzled  about the wide and definitive use of polls throughout the entire media landscape to both create and promote narrative. Have you ever done any thinking or writing about this?
— Avia, Stoddard, New Hampshire
Tangle: We've definitely given polls a skeptical eye in this newsletter before. One of the more popular pieces we did was a reflection on 2020 polling, and to what degree they were right or wrong (that's a subscribers-only piece). The spoiler there is that in the end the polls were actually more accurate than people gave them credit for.
A lot of people have written about this, but the general thrust of the issue with polls right now is that the people most likely to take them are typically more liberal. There are a lot of reasons for this, but the big one is a social psychology phenomenon where people who are left-leaning politically tend to be more trustful generally, which makes them more likely to pick up a call from a random number and then divulge their worldviews to a stranger for 20 minutes on the phone. As such, polls need to correct for this imbalance, which they were very bad at doing in 2016, but only somewhat bad at in 2020.
As for the media creating narratives, the answer is pretty simple: A writer wants a sense of their audience’s opinions, but it's impossible to talk to everyone. As a reporter, let me tell you that every journalist's dream would be to have the omniscient power to speak to every living American on every important political question and get a crystal clear, perfect view of the pulse of the country. The fact that we can't do that limits us. We are left, instead, to interview a dozen or so people (if you're good at your job), look at publicly available polling, and then look at the previous work related to the topic you're covering.
That last part is where the narrative comes in. Most journalists are, in some ways, building on the knowledge and work done by other journalists. This is true in every profession: Musicians sample each other's music; doctors work off of research done by predecessors or contemporaries; police officers learn from more experienced partners or steal ideas from other departments.
But in journalism, the effect of many reporters using the same set of polls and referencing the same previous reporting is the inadvertent (or sometimes, intentional) formation of narrative. The danger, of course, is that when such reporting and polls are wrong, misleading, or in some way inaccurate, the entire narrative becomes divorced from reality, and eventually the story falls apart.
So, polls can be informative. They are probably most informative when the results are from the same pollsters observing a change (which reliably indicates a new trend or movement on an issue). They are necessary context for reporters and audiences given the limitations of any person’s abilities to speak to thousands or millions of people. But, when paired with incomplete reporting, they can also be used to build narratives that belie reality. And that's the challenge of doing great reporting!

A story that matters. 
The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that it ended the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. The announcement came hours after a judge lifted an order that it be reinstated. On June 30, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Biden administration, saying it could end the policy. Now, DHS says the program will be unwound in a "quick and orderly manner." About 70,000 migrants were subject to the policy between the time Trump enacted it and Biden ended it (on his first day in office). In July alone, the U.S. Border Patrol reported nearly 200,000 encounters with migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Associated Press has the story.

Have a nice day. 
On June 29, 1988, Patrick Combs was walking to work when he came across a woman on a street corner giving birth. The shocking happenstance left Combs receiving a baby in his outstretched arms, a story so surprising and miraculous that it landed him on the front page of The San Francisco Chronicle. The child, Searcy Hughes, was later adopted and raised in Virginia. But as she grew up, she heard strange tales of her birth, and that it was "kind of a big deal." So she had a friend look up the story on Ancestry.com, which featured the old Chronicle story, and led Hughes directly to Combs. This year, the 34 year old Hughes finally met the 54 year old Combs. Naturally, the San Francisco Chronicle has the story.

What's up everyone!! I do not have a ton of time to write an email today. But I committed to write one, so I will give the highlights of this last week:

	•	I left Mesquite! Said bye to all the members and friends there. 
	•	I got my trainee, Elder Zimmerman! He is 18 years old and from Gilbert, AZ. He is super enthusiastic about the work and loves to work hard.
	•	We went back to Mesquite Sunday night for Mono and Berto's baptism! Over 200 people showed up to support them, it was AMAZING!
	•	This past week was significantly more stressful than any other week on my mission to this point with training and whitewashing. But it's getting better every day.
	•	Super excited for this upcoming week. Lots to do and lots to learn!!!!

"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

Hey Snackers,
How much is one Zuck worth? A camp counselor’s about to find out, after unearthing a rare baseball card featuring a young Mark Zuckerberg holding a bat. Baby Zuck had given the signed card to the counselor as a gift. We’ll see whether Zuck puts MLB players to shame at auction.
Stocks ticked down Friday on news that the US had added 528K jobs last month — more than double what was expected — and finally recovered all jobs lost during the pandemic. In this inflationary economy, good news is bad news: investors worry the hot labor market will compel the Fed to hike rates more aggressively. Yesterday, Senate Dems passed their $739B climate and healthcare bill (aka: The Inflation Reduction Act), sending it to the House.

SWIPED
Visa and Mastercard are profiting from higher swipe fees and growing debt, but their swipe-opoly is under fire
Swipe left… Your local grocery and Disney have a common enemy: card fees. This spring, Visa and Mastercard hiked the “swipe fees” they charge merchants for card purchases. FYI: merchants can pass swipe costs on to shoppers. Visa and Mastercard process 83% of US credit cards and earned $55B+ from swipe fees last year. But the duopoly is under scrutiny:
	•	New rules: The Senate’s finalizing a bill that would boost payment competition by forcing banks to use several partners, versus exclusively using Visa or Mastercard. More competition’s expected to reduce fees by $11B+ annually.
	•	New suits: This month Disney sued Visa and Mastercard, alleging they were essentially fixing fees — they settled privately. Walmart, Kroger, Amazon, and others have won billions doing the same.
	•	Scandals: Last week a judge greenlighted a suit against Visa for processing payments for Pornhub parent MindGeek (which is accused of enabling child sex abuse). The case could make payment juggernauts responsible for all transactions they process.
Land of the fee… home of the paid. US retailers pay 7X more in swipe fees than European retailers, which cap card fees. Most of that fee $$ goes to the bank that actually issued your card, because the bank is the one paying the merchant. But networks like Visa and Mastercard, which move your $5 latte payment from your bank to your coffee shop, are cashing in too:
	•	Booming profits: Visa’s and Mastercard’s profits surged last quarter, and Visa’s 66% profit margin is the S&P 500’s highest.
	•	Soaring IOUs: Credit-card balances spiked 13% last quarter, the biggest jump in 20+ years, as savings dwindled and inflation sizzled.
 
THE TAKEAWAY
The swipe economy is changing… Swipe fees increase costs for US families by $700 annually, on average, and hit low-income shoppers hardest. Now lawsuits and legislation could rewrite payment rules and curb the swipe-opoly. Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard are building in-house buy now, pay later systems and crypto products to unlock revenue beyond swipes. But they’ll face scrutiny: last year the DOJ blocked Visa’s $5.3B acquisition of pay-tech giant Plaid.

ZOOM OUT
Stories we’re watching...
Ready, player none… The pandemic gaming boom is over. Global video-game sales are expected to fall this year for the first time in seven years. Last week, gaming titan Activision Blizzard (“Call of Duty,” “Overwatch”) said its quarterly revenue was $600M lower than a year ago. Nintendo’s Switch sales plunged 60%, Microsoft reported lower gaming revenue as Xbox sales slipped, and FIFA legend EA lowered its sales forecast. Up next to report: Roblox. Supply woes, recession jitters, and IRL fun are expected to shrink gaming sales by 9% this year.
BTS is back... we're not talking K-pop. This year’s back-to-school season will be pricey: families with kids in elementary through high school plan to spend, on average, $864 on supplies, up $168 from 2019. Retailers including Walmart and Target have cut their sales outlooks as households prioritize essentials like groceries and Ticonderoga pencils over new laptops. Still, overall BTS spend is on pace to match last year's $37B record. Some parents are dipping into savings to afford supplies. Now, some states are offering sales-tax holidays for BTS shopping.

EVENTS
Coming up this week...
Love at first swipe… for Bumble investors. The dating (and networking) biz, where women make the first move, saw a 24% revenue bump last quarter as its 3M+ paying users spent more $$ on app perks. Now Bumble’s targeting Gen Z with cheaper subscriptions and more digi-gift offerings (think: $5 virtual bouquet). Still, global dating-app downloads have dipped as people pick IRL meetups over speed-swiping. Tinder owner Match saw its shares plunge last week after reporting slowing growth. We’ll see whether Bumble felt the same heat when it reports Wednesday.
Taking home the mini shampoo… Don’t forget free cotton swabs. Hotel staple Hyatt reports tomorrow amid the travel rebound. The leisure + hospitality sector led July job gains as restaurants and hotels scrambled to hire (they’re still 1.2M positions short of prepandemic levels). Hospitality stocks have gained over the past month after strong earnings from Hilton and Marriott, whose revenue per available room surged 70% year over year. Airbnb had its best quarter ever with record bookings. We’ll see if Hyatt swung back to a profit.

ICYMI
Last week's highlights...
	•	Batted: After spending $90M on “Batgirl,” Warner Discovery is scrapping the DC flick (which it had planned to release directly to HBO Max). Warner’s new execs are shifting focus back to box-office hits as losses mount.
	•	Taipei: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest-ranking US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. Last week’s historic visit drew China’s wrath and rattled global markets.
	•	Bubbly: Pepsi invested $550M in “healthy” energy-drink maker Celsius. As soda declines, big bev companies have shifted to functional beverages (think: vitamin-packed energy drinks and enhanced waters).

What else we're Snackin'
	•	Friend: A study analyzing 21B Facebook friendships found that low-income kids with wealthier friends earn more as adults. Researchers say cross-class friendships help economic mobility more than school quality.
	•	Jackpot: The US got lotto fever last month when the Mega Millions jackpot hit $1.3B, but the frothy payout might not have been the only driver: high ticket sales can be a sign of economic desperation.
	•	OOTD: TikTok is becoming outfit Tok. Insta attracts 3X more influencer-marketing spend from brands, but the Tok’s surpassed FB as a fashion-marketing go-to — and is on track to steal YouTube’s second-place spot.

Tim,

It has been a pleasure working with you this summer and I am very grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow as a machine learning engineer. With the end of the internship approaching, will you write a short recommendation for me on LinkedIn?

I am trying to grow my network and improve my portfolio and professional image online. LinkedIn is a great tool that recruiters use, and a solid recommendation from my first boss in the industry would be a valuable asset for future opportunities.

Addavox has huge potential and I'm looking forward to continue working with you through the school year, and probably after I graduate if you let me. 

I will send you a recommendation link to your profile for you to fill it out there.

Sincerely,

-Bryant McArthur

ABOUT YOUR UPCOMING TRAVELS




Dear Guest,
Due to speed limitations caused by a technical issue with one of the ship’s engines, we’ve replaced our visit to Icy Strait Point, Alaska with Ketchikan, Alaska. Additionally, instead of visiting Endicott Arm & Dawes Glacier on Friday, we’ll have a full day in Juneau, Alaska.
Your safety, and that of our crew, is always our top priority. Our ship has four engines, but one requires some repair and there’s a delay in receiving the parts needed. Additionally, another engine is scheduled for routine maintenance soon, which means we’ll have to reduce our overall speed. Our ships can safely sail in these kinds of situations at reduced speeds, and while we’re working to expedite the repair process, the global supply chain issues that we’re all experiencing are complicating this situation. 
The decision to modify our itinerary wasn’t taken lightly. We’ve done everything possible to minimize the impact to your time with us, and we’re terribly sorry for the inconvenience. To help make up for these changes, we’re providing you with an onboard credit:
	•	$75 USD for Interior and Ocean View staterooms 
	•	$100 USD for Balcony staterooms
	•	$200 USD for Suites
Your credits will be available for you once onboard and can be used anywhere on the ship. If you have a remaining amount left over at the end of the cruise, it will be refunded to your card on file.
Nevertheless, we’re excited to take you to a new port and spend some extra time in Juneau! Below, please find our revised Quantum of the Seas August 22nd, 2022 itinerary.

Ketchikan is your gateway to the wild landscapes and seascapes of Misty Fjords National Monument. Home to three tribes of the Northwest Coast Indians, it’s a great place to get a taste for the local culture. Check out its colorful, hand carved totems that line the city’s streets and park, and in the stilted homes that cling to Deep Mountain’s slopes. In Juneau, take your pick of activities ranging from whale watching in Stephens Passage to setting out on a dog-sledding expedition with the Alaskan Huskies. Located just 12 miles from town, the Mendenhall Glacier is ready for you to explore its beauty and majesty. Be sure to take some time and enjoy this amazing natural wonder while in Juneau. Whatever you decide to do, these destinations have endless opportunities for any adventure seeker!
Our Shore Excursions team will automatically reschedule any pre-paid Royal Caribbean International shore excursions booked for Skagway and Juneau affected by this change. In the meantime, feel free to browse all the exciting shore excursion options for your sailing in Cruise Planner to level-up your vacation.
Thanks for your understanding. We can’t wait to welcome you onboard Quantum of the Seas!

Hey everyone!

We found out transfer news yesterday! My time here in Mesquite is officially coming to a close. I will be heading up back to St George! I will be training a new missionary while whitewashing the area; it will be super fun! I will find out who my new companion will be on Wednesday, so I still have two more days here in Mesquite. I am a little sad to be leaving Mesquite behind, however I am honestly beyond ecstatic for this opportunity to train someone in a fresh area! It will stretch me in ways I need to be stretched. I look forward to new trials and challenges that await, for they will provide opportunities to increase my faith in Jesus Christ.

A couple highlights from this past week:
	•	Nancy's Mom, Delila accepted a baptismal date for August 13th!
	•	Esmeralda prayed to know if this is the true church and she had a dream where Jesus Christ talked to her and told her to keep reading the Book of Mormon and it'll give her the answer she is looking for
	•	Noche de Hogar! It was a blast. Not as many people showed up as we would've liked, but it was still a great turnout.
	•	We took Ron, Nancy and their whole family to the St George Temple Visitor's center. They loved it. They will be going to the Las Vegas temple this next week to do baptisms for the dead!
23 And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.
24 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.
Alma 7:23-24

My invitation is to pick a Christlike attribute from the above verses and improve on it over this next week. I promise as you do so, you will feel God's power greater  in your own life. You will have the strength to resist temptation. You will feel the joy that comes from aligning your will with His.

May we always abound in good works.

Elder Rasmussen

You all need to complete some precheckin steroids for the cruise.
Uploading passports, pics etc.

You can do it on the web, or on the app.  Download the royal Caribbean app and select checkin.  You will need your reservation number which you can get from the attached docs- these aren't the final ones, but the res number is the same.

Let me know if you have any questions, or when you've got your completed.

Is anyone interested in doing a little prep to share some info they learn with the group other than Tyler?  When should we "do" that?

HIGHS AND LOWS THIS WEEK
 
 
Hello. Highs and lows from Washington, D.C. this week. My high happened while I was at Day's Market in Provo. This past Monday, I was out working in the hot sun and I needed to have a cold drink. So, I ran to Day's Market, got a soda, and went to check out at the register. While standing in line, I had a great experience that just made my day. Please watch my video on Instagram to hear the whole story. This will be my high for a very, very long time. 
 
My low, we heard last night that the Democrats had come up with a reconciliation scheme. I do mean scheme because this is going to spend another trillion dollars. It's going to increase taxes at the very moment that we have too much money in the economy causing this inflation. They're going to pour money into the economy. It is a bad idea. It also looks like they have the ability to pass it. I sure hope not. It's the low for the week.
 
I hope you're all well.
  
 
  
 
GET REAL WITH JOHN
 
 
This week I want to break down the reconciliation and what is happening in the Senate. The bottom line is this: more spending as we head into a recession is not the answer. 
  
 
  
 
FLOOR MESSAGE OF THE WEEK
 
 
Earlier this week, I spoke on the House floor in favor of the Protecting Mental Health Services Act. This bill permanently allows for telehealth services for mental health under Medicare. COVID-19 highlighted the importance of telehealth, especially in providing quality care for rural communities. While Utah has for the most part returned to regular life, it is important that we keep in place these telehealth flexibilities that give Utahns control over their healthcare.

Linda is coming home next week from Brazil for hip surgery which necessitated adding an air-conditioner, which, in turn, resulted in some preparation.  And, as a result, there is a small ceiling patch that needs painting, and some decorative rock that needs re-arranging.  Probably 30 minutes each.  
Any help will be appreciated.

I've read that WaveGlow is more robust in handling several languages, but WaveRNN is language dependent and quickly degrades when you train on an additional language. If I were to create a multilingual system would it still be better to use WaveRNN and train several different models? Or use a single WaveGlow model that could essentially handle any language? What would my cost be in quality and Speed?
I did not play around with it yet, but some time ago I came across this repo on multilingual TTS in a single synthesizer: https://github.com/Tomiinek/Multilingual_Text_to_Speech
They're using WaveRNN, so I assume the quality really just depends on whether the Vocoder has been trained with good multilingual samples. In the end the vocoder is used to render a generated AI voice more natural; so it 'should' not matter which language the voice is speaking in.

What's Hijacking So Many Beautiful Relationships? A Mindful Approach to the Scary Moment When You "Don't Feel It Anymore"
 
 
 
So many good couples - dating and married - are dissolving right before our eyes. Why? Is it always because it "just wasn't right" or is there more going on? In this discussion, we'll explore the case for a profound and largely hidden influence that comes from popular narratives of romance that get downloaded and absorbed (unawares) by lovers today - and lived out in many consequential ways. For instance, when the level of initial intense attraction ebbs and settles (as it always does - like, for everyone!), a surprising number of couples are reaching the conclusion, "I must not love you anymore" - hardly aware of other ways of making sense of this same moment and working through it in healthy, love-building ways.

What’s up? It’s Coinbase Bytes 
There’s never a dull moment on the blockchain. Here’s what you need to know this week:
	•	Bitcoin gave up most of last week’s gains. Tesla announced it sold 75% of its BTC, and mining “difficulty” dropped for a third straight week.
	•	Vitalik Buterin explained Etherum’s future after the merge. There are four subsequent, rhyming stages that will improve scalability, says ETH’s co-founder. 
	•	The metaverse is having another moment. From Dubai to Tokyo, the metaverse is going global.

BTC UPDATE 
This week in Bitcoin: Tesla’s balance sheet and dropping mining difficulty
The coming week could be an eventful one for Bitcoin as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again and a number of big tech firms are scheduled to release earnings, all of which could add more volatility to an already jittery market. But before we cross that bridge, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap was in the news this week due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk announcing the electric car maker had sold the majority of its BTC. Meanwhile, mining firms have seen a simultaneous increase in sustainability and a drop in difficulty, as many unplug to bolster U.S. energy grids. Let’s take a look behind the headlines.
	•	During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call last week, Elon Musk announced the company sold 75% of its BTC, worth about $936 million. Musk explained that Tesla raised this capital defensively due to uncertainty about Covid lockdowns in China that halted manufacturing in Shanghai for three weeks. “This should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin,” Musk said. In 2021, Tesla became one of the most visible institutional BTC buyers after purchasing $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency. 
	•	Energy sources for Bitcoin mining saw a Q2 improvement to 59.5% sustainability, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council. The global forum of mining firms collected data from over 50% of the Bitcoin network via a voluntary survey and found a 6% increase in sustainability from the previous year, and a 2% boost from the previous quarter. According to the report, Bitcoin mining makes up 0.15% of the global energy supply.
	•	Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty saw its largest drop in a year as miners turned off machines during a U.S. heatwave. Mining difficulty refers to the amount of computer power required to mine new BTC on the Bitcoin network — the more miners/power plugged into the network, the higher the difficulty. Last Thursday saw a 5% drop in difficulty as American miners likely turned off machines as electricity prices spiked during extreme heat, particularly in Texas. This was the third consecutive difficulty decrease since BTC prices crashed in June.

Why it matters… Since last week’s Tesla news, BTC has gradually shed about 10%, though it is still up roughly 20% since mid-June’s lows under $18,000. As analysts and retail investors alike try to determine if the market bottom is already in, diverging opinions have emerged. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently said the “worst is over” while analysts at blockchain analytics firm Glassnode note the possibility that “further downside and/or consolidation time is required to establish a bottom.” While no one can say what will happen in the future, investors who have taken the long view with crypto have historically been rewarded.

RHYME TIME 
Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin says after ETH’s merge you can expect the surge, verge, purge, and splurge
Last week, the entire crypto market rallied on the updated September timeline for Ethereum’s long-awaited merge upgrade, which will see the blockchain move from energy-intensive proof-of-work mining to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake system. But the merge is only half the story — 55% to be exact — according to ETH co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who spoke about the future of the blockchain at the Ethereum Community Conference in France last Thursday. Per Buterin (the Dr. Seuss of crypto?) Ethereum will see subsequent, rhyming upgrades called the “surge,” “verge,” “purge,” and “splurge.” Let’s take a quick look at the playfully named upgrades.

	•	The merge is Ethereum’s first major upgrade, which will see the blockchain move to proof-of-stake validation to verify transactions and unlock new ETH. The upgrade will “merge” the current proof-of-work blockchain with a proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain, which has been running since 2020.
	•	The surge will increase scalability and enable faster, cheaper transactions via a process called “sharding,” which essentially divides large pieces of data into smaller shards, making it even easier for layer-2 blockchains (like Polygon) to operate more efficiently on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. “Ethereum today can process 15 to 20 transactions per second,” Buterin explained. With sharding, “it’s going to be able to process 100,000 transactions per second.”
	•	The verge refers to technical upgrades that will allow users to become network validators — computers responsible for verifying ETH transactions — without having to store massive amounts of data, which is “great for decentralization,” Buterin said.
	•	The purge is a phase that aims to remove old network history to ease network bottlenecks and further reduce the amount of hard drive space required for validators.
	•	The splurge includes final tweaks and fine tuning of previous steps that, according to Buterin, is the “fun stuff that will make Ethereum into a much more powerful system.”

Why it matters… Part of taking the long-view on crypto is recalling that Bitcoin is only 13 years old, while Ethereum is only seven. During Buterin’s presentation he contended that while “Bitcoiners consider Bitcoin to be 80% complete … Ethereans consider Ethereum to be 40% complete.” As the crypto market evolves alongside the underlying technology, it’s important to remember an oft-repeated phrase from Crypto Twitter — we’re still early.

THE META NARRATIVE 
From Dubai to Tokyo to the cover of Time Magazine, the Metaverse is having a moment 
“The Next Digital Era Will Change Everything” was the headline atop a recent issue of Time magazine that featured a deep dive “into the metaverse” from Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist and author of a new book about the buzzword that refers to our theoretical, all-encompassing digital future. But this moment of mainstream recognition wasn’t the only notable metaverse development in recent weeks. Here’s a quick roundup.
	•	The Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, unveiled the emirate’s “Metaverse Strategy” in a series of tweets last week. Sheikh Hamdan’s plan for the metaverse economy in Dubai over the next five years consists of quintupling the number of metaverse and blockchain companies, supporting 40,000 additional virtual jobs, and adding $4 billion to the economy, with the ultimate goal of entering the world’s top 10 metaverse economies and becoming “a global frontrunner in adopting digital solutions.” 
	•	A number of leading web3 brands have come together to establish the “Open Metaverse Alliance for Web3,” with the goal of creating a set of standards that will enable the industry to address the challenges of interoperability and build a metaverse where individual platforms are interconnected, open, and decentralized. OMA3, which will operate as a DAO, follows the founding last month of the Metaverse Standards Forum, a group formed by tech giants such as Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, and Sony. 
	•	The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton, a leading U.S. business school, announced it’s launching an online course called “Business in the Metaverse Economy,” which it says is the first program focused on the metaverse from an Ivy League institution. Meanwhile in Japan, the University of Tokyo will soon begin offering courses on the fundamentals of the metaverse that will be conducted in, appropriately, the metaverse. The courses are aimed at addressing a “shortage of personnel skilled to handle digital transformation,” according to newspaper Asahi Shimbun. 

Why it matters… While the metaverse may indeed “change everything,” it is still in its infancy, and the nascent industry, along with the broader web3 space, will require significant investment, collaboration, and user adoption in order to displace the centralized web2 era and reframe ideas around individual ownership across the internet. This week’s headlines illustrate how this work is moving forward, and even Time magazine can’t help but take notice.

The Degen Trilogy and the NFT-powered future of filmmaking
A question for all the cinephiles out there — what would it look like to make a blockbuster for the blockchain era? This week, Coinbase is teasing the answer to that question with part one of The Degen Trilogy, an interactive short film series that combines NFT technology with the collective ethos of the NFT community. After hosting a casting call for Bored Ape Yacht Club owners, seven NFTs were cast in the web3 action adventure, each with smart-contract enabled licensing. For the first time ever, NFT owners get to participate in and benefit from the on-screen action. And this is just the start.

Subject: Message from ROCKWELL RANCH TOWNHOME OWNERS ASSOCIATION INC - Rockwell Ranch Townhomes - URGENT! Pool Security Breach and Trespassing - [#XN338121]

If you would like to respond to this notification, please place your response above the dotted line. 


Rockwell Ranch Association Owner,
There have been several incidents of the unauthorized use of the pool. THE POOL IS NOT OPEN FOR USE. Any entry at this time is considered trespassing. 
It is understandable that the pool may look open and ready, but the Utah County Health Department has not issued a permit for use. Any usage prior to this certificate further delays acquiring that permit and may forfeit the privilege for the 2022 season, causing a permanent shut down and denial of operation. There has been NO notification sent to the community indicating that the clubhouse facility or pool is open and available. Every person who has used the pool thus far has trespassed on private property and put the association at liability and risk. 
 As a result of people being in a pool that is not adequately chemically treated for use, the pool has turned green (failing an inspection with County) and resulted in several thousand dollars in cleaning, additional chemicals, and delays with the health department. This is the direct result of those who jumped the fence, adults who put children over the fence to open the gate, opened the release from the inside of the fence, or allowed others into the pool area while in violation of trespass themselves. 
 While we have extensive footage of those who have breached the perimeter fence, trespassed, and/or opened the gates for others, we request your assistance in reporting those known to have used the pool over the past week. We are currently matching key fob swipe attempts with the surveillance video footage to identify those who have trespassed and put the community liabilities at risk. All identified are subject to a loss of access to the amenities for 30 days.
You must have an active key fob to enter the property. Additional measures are being taken to strengthen security access points into the pool deck and protect the community liabilities. 
 Important: Please DO NOT open the pool gates for others who are not part of your immediate party. Those who cannot enter via a key fob may have 1-) lost their access privileges to the clubhouse/pool, 2-) be in violation, or 3-) may NOT be a Rockwell Ranch resident with permissions to use the pool. 
 We are asking for your help and cooperation: It is imperative that you protect this property. Every owner at Rockwell Ranch shares the cost, liability, and responsibility of this amenity. Every repair, damage, overuse, or abuse will be collectively impacted financially by the three sub-associations (Single, Towns, Condos). It will take the diligence of the entire community to keep the operational costs to this facility down and the HOA Master dues at a reasonable rate long-term.
 Barring any more setbacks, it is anticipated that the Rockwell Ranch Master Association will receive the pool permit this week. Once acquired, a notice will go out to the communities of Rockwell announcing the open availability and hours of operation and an addendum of RULES of use for the facility, including how to reserve/rent the Clubhouse. 
 If you need to contact or report anything related to the clubhouse, pool, or sport court areas, please email the Rockwell Ranch Master at rockwellranchmaster@gmail.com 
 Thank you for doing your part to make and keep the Rockwell Ranch communities a great place to live!

The driver of the Mazda 3 still has a bodily injury claim that is open and pending. We will continue handling the claim until settlement can be reached.

¡Qué tal todos!

Elder Kingrey and I have had another fantastic week here in the Virgin Valley.

Nathan Jimenez and Sophia Gonzales got baptized on Saturday! It was such a special experience to be there with their entire families. About 70% of the active members of our branch were out of town so we were a little worried about the turnout, but so many people showed up; the support was amazing! I think my favorite part about Nathan and Sophia getting baptized is that it brought their whole family back into activity! The Jimenez/Gonzales family are just some flat out amazing people.

One problem Elder Kingrey and I are running into is that the investigators/recent converts/less active members are now outnumbering the active members of the branch. It's a good problem to have, however we are finding ourselves having to pull teeth to get active members to befriend and fellowship these people who are coming to church. It's been difficult to create this support system that these people need with such few numbers, but we are doing the best we can. We are going to focus a lot of our efforts this upcoming week on meeting with the active members of the branch and assigning specific people to each member with specific action items to follow up on (1 in person contact/week, 3 text messages/week etc). We want these people who are coming to church to feel welcome and to feel wanted here! In the inspired words of President Gordon B Hinkley, 

"Every new convert needs three things:
1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems.
2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. …
3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism”

I will do the best I can to make sure I do my part in helping these people remain active in the church. I know I can't control everything that happens or that will happen, but I sure can do everything possible to provide a solid support system for these beloved children of God.

This is the last week of the transfer! Elder Kingrey and I do not know what the future holds for us together, but we are determined to continue pushing forward with an eye of faith. Our teaching pool has thinned recently, so we will be spending more time finding the elect. They are out there, and "are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" Doctrine and Covenants 123:12. 

Press forward Saints!

Yeah 123 is pretty hot, we only got up to 107 in Utah and I thought that was hot. 

Guess what though, I was number one salesman in Moxie today.  Lol Miles called me this Monday to see if I would come knock in Florida with them for just the final round of team tourney and they had permission from daniel and Tim that if I came and helped them win I would be able to go on the trip to Rio with them. So I bought my plane ticket at 11:30 and and boarded the plane at 12:30 and I'm just selling for four days before I go back home. So I did decent my first two days with 5 and 6 and then today I had 9 but they were all bimonthlies so I had more revenue than Jayden Schouten with 12. Feels good. Anyways it felt good to be only selling for 3 days and still be back on top of the leader boards against these guys that have been selling for 3 or 4 months.

But yeah we won the round so now we're going to Rio in October. 

Anyways keep up the good work.

God Speed.

Happy Monday family and friends!

This week was a wild one; I hope I can remember everything that happened. We had so many great, uplifting experiences that have me "in awe of Christ and His Gospel." I am grateful to be able to share these experiences I'm having with you guys.

We are getting ready for Sophia and Nathan's baptism this week. They will be baptized this Saturday at 5pm. Sophia is the daughter of a lady we are teaching, Cecilia. Cecilia is a single mom with two young daughters, Sophia being one of them. Sophia will be the first member of her family to be baptized! She is 12 years old and absolutely loves the Gospel. It has been hard for her to leave behind her Catholic beliefs, because her father was a devout Catholic before he passed away. However she has expressed the desire to be baptized as a sign of leaving her old beliefs behind and to begin a new life. She has so much courage and is such a brave young girl. We hope her mom follows her example and enters the waters of baptism soon after.

Nathan is the 9 year old son of Armida Jimenez. Armida and her family have been inactive for the last several years but have been returning to activity recently. They have been coming not only to support Nathan in his decision in becoming a member of the church, but also because they all know that keeping the Sabbath Day holy is a commandment from God and will bring them blessings if they obey it. It has touched my heart to see the many sacrifices that this family has made to come back to church. Armida has taken work off on Sundays, and the same with her oldest daughter Emily. They have come back early from camping trips multiple times in order to make it on time to sacrament meeting. So many little things that have made a tremendous difference in their lives.

This past Sunday was such a hectic day! Our branch president and his family were out of town and so was Ron and Nancy's family. Even without these two families, in total there were 56 people at sacrament meeting. We had 7 investigators at church, and about 10 less-active members there as well. It was so amazing seeing everyone there! But the coolest part to me was we had 11 youth in Sunday School!! When we got here in May, there was only one. It was such a cool sight to see. The cool thing is, is that they all know each other from school! So it wasn't awkward at all the second hour of church. One of these youth is Mono. he is 14 years old and plays on the high school basketball team. Elder Kingrey and I have been teaching him and his buddies for a few weeks now and this past Friday night he calls us and tells us he wants to be baptized on August 7th! We had to check our schedule for that day to see if we could fit him in, and luckily we could (summer sales joke haha). We will continue to teach him and try to help his friends get on board with him.

Lots and lots of great things going on here in Mesquite. The Lord has seen fit to hasten the work at this time in this area; Elder Kingrey and I are just trying to do our part in keeping up. It is difficult for me to put into words how lucky I feel to be on a mission right now. There is nothing, absolutely nothing I would rather be doing right now. I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. I feel that I am beginning to understand Christ's words to the Nephites when he commanded them to "lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

What's up cuz!

Yeah 123 is pretty hot, we only got up to 107 in Utah and I thought that was hot. 

Guess what though, I was number one salesman in Moxie today.  Lol Miles called me this Monday to see if I would come knock in Florida with them for just the final round of team tourney and they had permission from daniel and Tim that if I came and helped them win I would be able to go on the trip to Rio with them. So I bought my plane ticket at 11:30 and and boarded the plane at 12:30 and I'm just selling for four days before I go back home. So I did decent my first two days with 5 and 6 and then today I had 9 but they were all bimonthlies so I had more revenue than Jayden Schouten with 12. Feels good. Anyways it felt good to be only selling for 3 days and still be back on top of the leader boards against these guys that have been selling for 3 or 4 months.

But yeah we won the round so now we're going to Rio in October. 

Anyways keep up the good work.

God Speed.

Happy Monday family and friends!

This week was a wild one; I hope I can remember everything that happened. We had so many great, uplifting experiences that have me "in awe of Christ and His Gospel." I am grateful to be able to share these experiences I'm having with you guys.

We are getting ready for Sophia and Nathan's baptism this week. They will be baptized this Saturday at 5pm. Sophia is the daughter of a lady we are teaching, Cecilia. Cecilia is a single mom with two young daughters, Sophia being one of them. Sophia will be the first member of her family to be baptized! She is 12 years old and absolutely loves the Gospel. It has been hard for her to leave behind her Catholic beliefs, because her father was a devout Catholic before he passed away. However she has expressed the desire to be baptized as a sign of leaving her old beliefs behind and to begin a new life. She has so much courage and is such a brave young girl. We hope her mom follows her example and enters the waters of baptism soon after.

Nathan is the 9 year old son of Armida Jimenez. Armida and her family have been inactive for the last several years but have been returning to activity recently. They have been coming not only to support Nathan in his decision in becoming a member of the church, but also because they all know that keeping the Sabbath Day holy is a commandment from God and will bring them blessings if they obey it. It has touched my heart to see the many sacrifices that this family has made to come back to church. Armida has taken work off on Sundays, and the same with her oldest daughter Emily. They have come back early from camping trips multiple times in order to make it on time to sacrament meeting. So many little things that have made a tremendous difference in their lives.

This past Sunday was such a hectic day! Our branch president and his family were out of town and so was Ron and Nancy's family. Even without these two families, in total there were 56 people at sacrament meeting. We had 7 investigators at church, and about 10 less-active members there as well. It was so amazing seeing everyone there! But the coolest part to me was we had 11 youth in Sunday School!! When we got here in May, there was only one. It was such a cool sight to see. The cool thing is, is that they all know each other from school! So it wasn't awkward at all the second hour of church. One of these youth is Mono. he is 14 years old and plays on the high school basketball team. Elder Kingrey and I have been teaching him and his buddies for a few weeks now and this past Friday night he calls us and tells us he wants to be baptized on August 7th! We had to check our schedule for that day to see if we could fit him in, and luckily we could (summer sales joke haha). We will continue to teach him and try to help his friends get on board with him.

Lots and lots of great things going on here in Mesquite. The Lord has seen fit to hasten the work at this time in this area; Elder Kingrey and I are just trying to do our part in keeping up. It is difficult for me to put into words how lucky I feel to be on a mission right now. There is nothing, absolutely nothing I would rather be doing right now. I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. I feel that I am beginning to understand Christ's words to the Nephites when he commanded them to "lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" 3 Nephi 13:19-21.

Subject: Ways of Thinking has a History
Date: July 23, 2022 at 6:16:45 PM MDT
To: Garth Myres <garth.myres@gmail.com>

"One of the hardest things to convince students of in general is that ideas and ways of thinking and ways of understanding the world have a history. Although most generations and cultures view their own ways of thinking about the world as somehow “natural,” ideas, including our most fundamental ways of thinking, change over time and have a particular history. Revolutions in ways of thinking are in many ways the most influential and far-reaching of all revolutions.”
Alan Kors

I read this quote as it related to teaching the Old Testament to youth. As I study the OT and learn more about the ancient cultures, I can learn more about how the ancient middle eastern people understood events and certain actions. This gives new meanings to stories I thought I knew. It is interesting to me how the Lord used their understanding and culture to teach the OT people. Modern prophets will usually speak in a different way to us and in our current understanding of the world.

HIGHS AND LOWS THIS WEEK
 
 
 
Hi! Another week for the highs and lows.
 
The high is that I had a bill, dealing with security in your home and protecting you from big tech, that passed through the Energy & Commerce Committee with unanimous votes from Republicans and Democrats. What the bill does is it ensures that if you buy a device, you'll be able to know or understand if there's a video camera or a microphone in it.
 
It doesn't sound like that should be something you should worry about. But more and more, you're going to see toasters, washing machines, and dishwashers coming as smart technology and the ability of a manufacturer to hide these devices in there just got nixed because of our bill. We'll get to the House floor, and I think we can get it all the way through. So super exciting! 
 
The low, I got to tell you, we have a fabulous employee here, Rebekah, who has been with us for years and she's had a promotion and is leaving our office. It's a low and high for us, too, because we really appreciate her and all the hard work. Rebekah, we will miss you a lot.  
 
  
 
GET REAL WITH JOHN
 
 
I am going to preface this right off the bat. This video is long. But, I know many do not get to see the behind the scenes on what a week in D.C. is like. With that in mind, I sat down with two of my staff members to discuss some votes we had in D.C. this week and how we got to our final vote decision. Watch below: 
 
 
  
 
READING OF THE WEEK
 
 
The Hummer EV produces more CO2 than a gas-powered sedan
 
In fact, the Hummer EV ends up producing more carbon dioxide per mile driven than some gas-powered vehicles, despite not filling up at the gas pump itself.

LEGISLATION OF THE WEEK: PRIVACY
 
 
I teased this somewhat in the Highs and Lows this week, but I am proud that my bill, the Informing Consumers About Smart Devices Act passed unanimously through committee. 
 
This common sense, bipartisan bill would require the creation of reasonable disclosure guidelines for products that have audio or visual recording components that are not clearly obvious to a reasonable person, such as household appliances. 
This emerging smart technology will provide unknown benefits and conveniences to modern life but along with this new technology we need updated transparency for consumers.
 
My bill balances protecting American consumers with continuing to foster innovation.
By working with a broad range of stakeholders, my legislation will ensure consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are putting in their homes without hamstringing the technological pioneers who are developing smart technologies.

SURVEY: CHINA
 
 
If you scrolled to the bottom of this newsletter, well thank you. I am always curious to know what you are thinking and would appreciate your help by answering this survey on the topic below.
 
  
 
Are we doing enough at the federal level to counteract the Chinese Communist Party influence around the world?
 
  
 
Yes, we are
 
  
 
No, we are not

Conditions of Carriage

Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example: 

• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.
• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.
• Our right to change terms of the contract.
• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.
• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.
• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight. 

Advice To Passengers On Limitations Of Liability

For international travel to or from another country, airline liability is governed by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention. There are no financial limits for death or bodily injury, and the airline may make an advance payment to cover immediate economic needs. The airline's liability for passenger delay, and for loss, delay or damage to baggage may be limited by the Conventions. In case of baggage, the liability limit is 1131 Special Drawing Rights (approximately US $1787) per passenger for international travel. The baggage limit is US $3,500 per ticketed passenger for US domestic travel. These baggage liability limitations apply unless you declare a higher valuation and pay additional charges at check-in. In case of international travel, any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of the actual or scheduled arrival of the aircraft; and, in case of baggage claims, written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in case of damage, and, in case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of the passenger. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.

What we learned from the January 6 hearings
BY ISAAC SAUL – 22 JUL 2022 – VIEW ONLINE → 
 
Image: Brett Davis 
Editor's note: At the urging of my staff, I have decided to make today's Friday post available to both free and paid subscribers, and the public.

The January 6 committee investigating the Capitol riots has now conducted eight public hearings since June 9th.
Those hearings have covered more than 1,000 interviews conducted by the committee, both publicly and privately, as well as a review of over 125,000 documents. While the committee says its work isn't complete, it looks like it is done with public hearings for now — with no more currently scheduled — and it seems likely that they won't resume any action until the fall, if at all.
So, we thought now would be a good time to review what the committee found, the story they described, and what we have learned.
Before we do, it's worth framing the committee's work. There are three main points I'd like to address.
First, it's important to note that the congressional committee's job is not to bring charges. The point of the January 6 committee is to answer questions about the events leading up to the riots at the Capitol: Was it planned or organized? What was the extent of the White House's involvement? Who knew what, and when?
The Committee was created by Congress to investigate these questions and to recommend changes in law, policy, rules or regulations in response to what they learn — and to prevent future violence or attempts at thwarting an election's certification. It was not created to charge anyone with crimes — and it won't. Instead, it will issue a formal report to Congress that may include recommendations on charges. The Justice Department has requested transcripts and evidence from the committee.
Second, as many on the right will be quick to point out, this is one of the more "partisan" congressional committees — in the literal sense — that has ever been assembled. That doesn't mean their work should be discounted, but it does mean there was more imbalance on this committee than is typical of Congressional hearings.
The origins of that story go back to the committee's formation. Democrats had tried to form a bipartisan Senate committee in the mold of the September 11th commission, but Senate Republicans blocked the formation of that committee. So, in the House, the group was designed to be made up of 13 members, five of whom were going to be picked by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).
In July of last year, McCarthy tapped Republican Reps. Jim Jordan (OH), Jim Banks (IN), Rodney Davis (IL), Kelly Armstrong (ND) and Troy E. Nehls (TX) to sit on the committee and represent Republicans. Immediately, the selection of Banks and Jordan, who each voted against certifying the results of the election, drew harsh criticism. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected both, saying they would jeopardize the integrity of the investigation because they could become subjects of it. She did not, however, turn down Rep. Nehls, who also voted against certifying the results (Pelosi said that was not the criteria for rejecting Banks and Jordan).
McCarthy responded to Pelosi by threatening to withdraw all five Republicans from the panel.
"Denying the voices of members who have served in the military and law enforcement, as well as leaders of standing committees, has made it undeniable that this panel has lost all legitimacy and credibility,” McCarthy said. “Unless Speaker Pelosi reverses course and seats all five Republican nominees, Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts.”
When Pelosi didn't budge on her objections, McCarthy followed up on his promise and withdrew all five of his picks. Former President Trump has criticized McCarthy for that decision — a move he says has allowed Democrats to craft the narrative they want. Pelosi selected Liz Cheney (R-WY) and Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), two critics of Trump, as the lone Republicans on the committee.
So, however you feel about McCarthy or Pelosi's decisions, it is only fair to preface what's to come with that knowledge.
Third, as many on the left are quick to retort, the witnesses whose testimony and communications are being used as evidence are almost entirely Republicans, Trump supporters, former Trump supporters, former Trump staffers, former members of Trump's campaign, and conservative media personalities. In no particular order, we've heard from Trump's handpicked attorney general, his former White House counsel, an aide working for Trump's chief of staff, Trump's daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, the former vice president's general counsel, the former vice president's chief of staff, the former Trump White House deputy press secretary, and even Trump's former campaign manager, among many others.
In other words, while the only two Republicans on the committee are longtime Trump critics, the witnesses and interviews include dozens and dozens of allies and former allies who were very close to the White House.
In today's edition, we aim to create a one-stop shop for what we've learned during the hearings and what the evidence is. Below, we've created eight sections — one for each hearing — with brief summaries of what was discussed, what kind of evidence and testimony was brought forward, and what the committee's takeaways were.
After that, we’ll share some questions that still remain from the hearings, some criticism of the evidence and testimony, and I’ll offer “my take,” the usual section wholly dedicated to my own opinion, separate from the rest of this newsletter.
One final reminder: Transcripts, video, and evidence from the committee's work are widely available online. We’ve sourced some of the facts and evidence here with hyperlinks, but if you are looking to verify any of the claims, you can find them in one of a few places:
	•	The January 6 committee YouTube page, which includes all of the hearings.
	•	The January 6 website, which includes press releases and hearings.
	•	This website from Just Security, highlighting evidence of criminality presented in the hearings.
	•	This independent website dedicated to tracking the events of January 6.
	•	You can also look up transcripts for any of the hearings, which have been published widely by news outlets from across the political spectrum.
We hope you find this informative and useful.

Hearing 1.
The first Congressional hearing took place on June 9th, 2022.
The focus of this hearing was an overview of the committee's work and the events that transpired on January 6th. During the hearing, we saw never-before-seen footage of the attack at the Capitol, including overhead security footage of how rioters breached the Capitol building and police lines. Perhaps most interestingly, the committee shared footage of interviews with Ivanka Trump, former attorney general William Barr, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.
We hear each person’s accounts of the events of the day during those interviews. Barr told investigators that he had repeatedly informed Trump his claims of election fraud were "bulls—" and that the Justice Department could not find any evidence supporting the claims made by people around Trump. Ivanka Trump told investigators she believed Barr and had accepted what he said about the election. Gen. Milley said that Vice President Mike Pence had requested assistance at the Capitol, but that the White House response was much different.
Among other revelations, the committee:
	•	Showed evidence of Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) and multiple other Republicans requesting presidential pardons after objecting to the results of the 2020 election.
	•	Aired interviews where former campaign adviser Jason Miller told investigators that he repeatedly warned Trump he was going to lose, based on the numbers they were seeing.
	•	Aired interviews of Trump lawyer Alex Cannon affirming that the White House could not produce any evidence of widespread election fraud.
	•	Showed text messages from Fox News host Sean Hannity to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, in which he implores her to stop talking about the stolen election, and raises the possibility of the Cabinet invoking the 25th amendment and removing Trump from office.
In live testimony, the committee also interviewed veteran Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, who was one of over 100 officers injured on Jan. 6. She was knocked unconscious during the riots. Edwards made the case, in very plain terms, that it was a "war scene," on the ground, “like something out of a movie.” After regaining consciousness she rejoined the police line and was tear-gassed and pepper sprayed, and at one point described slipping in fellow officers' blood.
On the whole, the committee demonstrated that there were people around Trump informing him repeatedly that he had legitimately lost the election, there was evidence that members of Congress who objected to the election results sought pardons (which the committee framed as knowledge of guilt), and there was the re-telling of what happened at the Capitol that day with footage of widespread violence and destruction, including members of Congress having to flee and hide to avoid being attacked by the mob.
The committee also made its first allegation that Trump did not want to stop the riots, that he was angry at advisers who were telling him to do more to prevent them, and that he was well aware of rioters chanting "Hang Mike Pence!" and thought that, maybe, they had the right idea (the testimony for these claims appears later).
The committee presented the first indication that Tony Ornato of the United States Secret Service (who was overseeing all presidential and vice presidential Secret Service agents that day) may have been assisting Trump in trying to get Pence out of the building and preventing him from certifying the Electoral College vote. 
The most compelling evidence for this is reporting that Pence’s National Security Advisor Keith Kellogg had been told by Ornato that the USSS intended to move Pence to Joint Base Andrews. Kellog replied, “You can’t do that Tony. Leave him where he’s at. He’s got a job to do. I know you guys too well. You’ll fly him to Alaska if you have a chance. Don’t do it.”

Hearing 2.
In the second hearing, which took place on June 13, the committee began to narrow its focus. This time, it keyed in on what was happening inside the Trump campaign in the days immediately following the 2020 election and leading up to January 6. Primarily, the committee laid out evidence that Trump was using claims of a stolen election to fundraise, that very little of the money was actually put toward legal battles, and that people around him tried to inform him that the election was not stolen.
Through on-camera testimony from Trump's campaign manager Bill Stepien, his senior adviser Jason Miller, and his former attorney general William Barr, the committee portrayed a divided White House. The split, Stepien tried to explain, was between "Team Normal", which understood they may lose the election, and a group cozying up to Trump that was ready to interpret any potential loss as a theft.
In interviews with the committee, these former staffers said they tried to explain to Trump the reality of what was happening: The outlook for them winning was bleak, the remaining votes were going to favor Biden, and the allegations percolating of some widespread fraud were, as Bill Barr put it, "idiotic" and "complete nonsense." Members of "Team Normal" described him as becoming increasingly detached from reality, following Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and others down a rabbit hole of conspiracies. Former Acting Attorney General Richard Donoghue said the Justice Department tried to investigate claims the White House presented to them, but were always left having to debunk them to Trump.
"He wouldn't fight us on it, he would just move on to another," Donoghue said in his taped testimony.
Among other things, the committee emphasized the following facts:
	•	The testimony featured in this hearing was all from Republicans and Trump supporters, including Stepien — who is still working to get Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman elected in Wyoming over Liz Cheney (the vice chair of the committee interviewing him).
	•	Trump and his team raised $250 million off of claims the election was stolen, much of which was never put toward actual litigation of the election.
	•	Most of that money went to groups supporting Trump like the Save America PAC, Trump’s largest campaign PAC.
	•	Hundreds of people are facing criminal charges for their actions, but very few of the people at the top (those most responsible for what happened) currently face any consequences.
On the whole, the committee made it clear that a large number of high-ranking, trusted officials around Trump were telling him he had lost the election, that Trump moved from one stolen election theory to another, and that Trump used the unfounded theories to raise hundreds of millions of dollars without actually spending much of that money on legal battles. Liz Cheney claimed Trump had "fleeced" his supporters.

Hearing 3.
In the third hearing, the committee focused on Vice President Mike Pence, the role he played in facilitating the transfer of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden, and the so-called "Eastman memo."
Pence, in the committee's telling, narrowly escaped violence or death on January 6, and was one of the few barriers between Trump and a complete Constitutional crisis.
The committee used a recreation of the mob's movement on January 6 to show that they came within 40 feet of where Pence was hiding inside the Capitol building. The committee presented testimony showing that secret service members were attempting to get Pence out of the building, into a car and onto an evacuation route, but Pence refused — instead insisting that he wanted to finish the ceremonial count of the electoral votes.
Through Pence's lawyer Greg Jacob and retired Judge Michael Luttig, who was advising Pence on the vice presidential role leading up to January 6, the committee received testimony that Pence was being pressured by Trump both privately and publicly to try to halt or subvert the electoral count.
Included in the evidence was testimony from several witnesses — including Ivanka Trump — that on the morning of January 6, before the riots, Pence and Trump had a "heated" phone call. Witnesses from both the White House and the vice president's office testified to the call happening. Ivanka Trump testified that her father used a "different tone" than she had heard before. Ivanka's chief of staff testified that Ivanka had told her Trump called Pence a "p—sy" in the phone call. Nicholas Luna, an assistant to the president, said Trump used the word "wimp."
Fifteen minutes after rioters had breached the Capitol, Trump was informed of the situation and urged by aides to do something in order to calm the mob down. Instead, at 2:24pm EST, he tweeted that "Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done." The committee also quoted a Proud Boys informant who had told the FBI that they "would have killed Mike Pence" if given the chance.
The committee also spent considerable time focusing on John Eastman, the lawyer who helped draft a memo that laid out an illegal plan to try to halt the Electoral College count and instead count new slates of electors from battleground states like Georgia and Arizona. The committee also shared an email from Eastman after Jan. 6, in which he asked Rudy Giuliani to be put on a pardon list. Eastman pleaded the fifth over 100 times in his interviews with the committee.
Among other things, the committee emphasized:
	•	Privately and publicly, before and after January 6, Trump repeatedly tried to pressure Mike Pence to intervene in the election.
	•	Had Pence not held his ground, he could have taken action that would have thrown the entire country into chaos.
	•	Trump knew Mike Pence was in danger on January 6, yet he encouraged the mob and continued to blame Pence anyway — even after rioters had breached the Capitol.
	•	John Eastman helped draft a memo that was given to Trump which laid out a strategy to illegally interfere in the election. Eastman then asked Giuliani to be put on a pardon list and pleaded the fifth over 100 times in his interviews with the committee.
	•	The day after January 6, Eastman called White House counsel Eric Herschmann and suggested a plan to contest the results of the election in Georgia. Herschmann testified that he asked Eastman if he was "out of your effing mind" and told him that he only wanted "to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on: 'orderly transition.'"
On the whole, the committee tried to make it clear how close Pence came to being physically harmed because of Trump’s tweets, and how, despite that, he played a critical role in preventing the election process from being thrown into chaos.

Hearing 4.
In the fourth hearing, the Jan. 6 committee focused on the pressure Trump put on state officials in order to help him overturn the results of the 2020 election, the role other Congressional Republicans played in the scheme, and the consequences of those false allegations being publicized. Once again, the committee presented testimony from almost exclusively Trump supporting Republicans: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling, Arizona House of Representatives Speaker Rusty Bowers, and RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
Raffensperger, Sterling and Bowers all told the committee a different version of the same story: Trump and his team repeatedly pressured them to subvert the election by trying to install their own pro-Trump electors and ignoring the audited results they had from their election investigations. Among other things, the committee emphasized that:
	•	Each witness said Trump was personally involved in contacting them and exerting pressure to overturn their state's results.
	•	On the morning of Jan. 6, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) called Bowers and asked him to support the decertification of his state's electors.
	•	The committee showed text messages from an aide to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson (WI) to an aide to Mike Pence, in which Johnson's aide asks how to hand-deliver a set of illegitimate electors from Michigan and Wisconsin that had not been delivered to the National Archives. Pence’s aide responds by telling him not to give them to the vice president.
	•	Five GOP House members, including Biggs, have still not complied with subpoenas from the committee for their testimony.
In the later parts of the hearing, the committee allowed Bowers to share how attention from the president impacted his daily life. Bowers testified about "disturbing" protests that happened at his home, and how his daughter was gravely ill at the time of protests. He read passages from his journal about friends who had turned on him because they believed he was no longer loyal to Trump.
Then, in the second half of the day, the committee interviewed Wandrea "Shaye" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, two election workers from Atlanta. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and One America News Network made false claims about Moss carrying out a fake ballot scheme during the election. In her testimony, Moss said that people threatened to hang her for committing treason, that her son received death threats, and that people visited her grandmother's home in an attempt to make a citizen's arrest. She had to go into hiding for two months after the FBI warned her that her life may be in danger.
In sum, the committee made the case that Trump's efforts to overturn the election were multi-faceted, that he was personally involved, and that there were serious real-world consequences for the people he and his team falsely accused of orchestrating election fraud.

Hearing 5.
The fifth hearing was led by Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and turned its focus to Trump's unsuccessful attempts to weaponize the Justice Department in order to stay in power. The committee used this hearing to connect several threads of their story, emphasizing that Trump and his team were simultaneously pushing Mike Pence, members of Congress, their supporters, state legislators, state officials, and members of the Justice Department to overturn the results of the election in a multi-faceted and coordinated effort.
Instead of Republican officials, this time the committee called forward three Trump appointees: former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, his deputy Richard Donoghue, and Steven Engel, who led the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.
Through the testimony of these witnesses, the committee described a high-stakes oval office meeting in December of 2020 where President Trump considered firing the acting attorney general and installing Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department official in the environmental division. Trump wanted to fire Rosen because he refused to publish a letter alleging that the election in Georgia was corrupt. Donoghue testified that Trump wanted the Justice Department to "just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest up to me and the Republicans."
Clark, meanwhile, had expressed support for using the powers of federal law enforcement officials to encourage state lawmakers to overturn Trump's election loss, and he had the support of Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who introduced him to Trump.
Rosen, who was in the room for the meeting, described Clark taking heavy criticism from other Justice Department officials. Donoghue said he tore into Clark's credentials in the meeting, and the absurdity of the idea that he could serve as attorney general. In his deposition, Donoghue said he told Clark, "You're an environmental lawyer. How about you go back to your office, and we'll call you when there's an oil spill." Witnesses also testified that Trump was informed there would be mass resignations at the Justice Department if he tried to fire Rosen and install Clark as attorney general.
The committee also revealed that Reps. Mo Brooks (R-AL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Scott Perry (R-PA) had all requested pardons from the president.  Brooks also sent an email to the White House, which the committee obtained, requesting a mass pardon for every congressman and senator who voted to reject the Electoral College vote submissions of Arizona and Pennsylvania.
Among other things, the committee emphasized that:
	•	Trump wanted to fire the acting attorney general and install an underqualified replacement specifically to overturn the result of the election.
	•	Trump only backed off from the plan after the Oval Office meeting where all of the high-ranking members of the Justice Department talked him out of it by threatening to resign en masse.
	•	Three witnesses said top officials were pushed to investigate wild conspiracies, like the idea that Italian satellites had changed votes from Trump to Biden.
	•	President Trump suggested to officials that they should seize voting machines.
Right before the hearing, Clark's home was raided by federal law enforcement, an investigative move the committee said it was not aware was going to happen.

Hearing 6.
The sixth hearing of the January 6 committee was inarguably the most dramatic (and the most controversial). It drew the most headlines, with descriptors like "shocking” or "blockbuster", and dominated social media for days. The committee’s biggest "surprise" was calling back Cassidy Hutchinson, a top aide to Mark Meadows, President Trump's chief of staff at the time of January 6. Hutchinson had already testified four times to the committee behind closed doors, and she had recently abandoned an attorney supplied by Trump's team in order to find her own representation.
Hutchinson relayed several new claims about January 6, President Trump, and conversations she had overheard in the White House. Included in her claims were:
	•	Allegations that Trump was upset his supporters were being put through metal detectors at his rally, and that he insisted: "They're not here to hurt me. Take the f-ing mags away. Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here."
	•	Allegations that President Trump had lost his temper because the Secret Service refused to take him to the Capitol after his rally, and that an agent had relayed a story to her in which Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of "The Beast," the vehicle that transports the president.
	•	Allegations that Trump lost his temper when the DOJ released a statement in December asserting there was no widespread voter fraud, in which he smashed his lunch against the wall and that she had helped aides clean it up.
Along with the testimony from Hutchinson, the committee presented National Security Council chat logs as evidence. In the logs, NSC officials are discussing and monitoring the movements of Trump, and at one point reference a route being cleared for him to head to the Capitol building. This contradicted Mark Meadows, who wrote in his book that Trump never intended to go to the Capitol building.
“MOGUL’s going to the Capital … they are clearing a route now,” a message sent to the chat log said (MOGUL was President Trump’s secret service code name). "MilAide has confirmed that he [Trump] wants to walk," another 12:32 p.m. message reads. "They are begging him to reconsider."
Hutchinson also testified about conversations she overheard in the Oval Office. In one, she alleges that Pat Cipollone, a White House lawyer, told Mark Meadows to "do something more" to stop the riots at the Capitol.
"They're literally calling for the vice president to be f**king hung," Hutchinson recalled Cipollone saying.
"'You heard him, Pat. He [Trump] thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong," Hutchinson said Meadows responded.
Finally, Hutchinson testified that Trump ultimately conceded that Biden had won the race on January 7th only because there was a concern that Pence and the Cabinet would invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from power.
The committee emphasized that President Trump knew his supporters at the rally were armed, dangerous, and had the potential for violence. Yet he still urged them to march to the Capitol, and further encouraged them once the Capitol had been breached.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee also suggested it had evidence of witness tampering for its proceedings. One witness, the committee said, was told by someone in Trump's orbit that Trump was "thinking about you" and that "he knows you're loyal" and hopes that "you're going to do the right thing when you go in for your deposition."

Hearing 7.
In the seventh public hearing, the Jan. 6 committee focused on how Trump's public speeches and tweets "summoned" a mob after all legal avenues proved fruitless. It also focused on the loose affiliations between Trump, his informal political advisers, and members of far-right militia groups like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. As evidence of their closeness to the administration, the committee played video of former Trump advisor Roger Stone taking the Proud Boys oath.
The committee used testimony from Trump’s aides, right-wing media and militia members to show that Trump's supporters believed the election was stolen because of his own words, and thought they were acting on his behalf. The committee also made the case that Trump viewed these various groups as his troops on the ground. Among other things, the committee emphasized:
	•	On December 19th, 2020, Trump tweeted: “ Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”
	•	This tweet led many in right-wing media and far-right militias to begin rallying support and organizing for that day.
	•	Supporters like Stephen Ayres, whose testimony was shared in the hearing, said “I was hanging on every word he was saying." Ayres was not planning to rush the Capitol, but decided to go after hearing Trump's speech.
	•	The committee shared a never-sent draft tweet that said: “Making a big speech at 10:00 A.M. January 6 south of the White House. Please arrive early. Massive crowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the Steal!!” They used this tweet as evidence that the march to the Capitol was pre-planned, not spontaneous.
	•	One text message that supported this claim came from rally organizer Kylie Kremer to MyPillow CEO Michael Lindell that said, "It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for it ‘unexpectedly.’”
Along with the pre-planned nature of the rally, the committee also shared more testimony from Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. He described walking into an Oval Office meeting where White House lawyers were facing off with Sidney Powell and Michael Flynn, who wanted Trump to seize voting machines in an attempt to prove fraud. President Trump, at one point, tried to appoint Powell as special counsel to investigate election fraud claims (he would later distance himself from Powell, after she failed to provide the White House promised fraud evidence).
Finally, the hearing included two in-person witnesses who spoke about their radicalization and how their lives had changed since that day. One was Jason Van Tatenhove, a former national spokesman for the Oath Keepers, who said the country was "lucky" there wasn't more bloodshed. The other was Ayres, a convicted rioter, who said he lost his job, sold his house and is now a criminal because of his radicalization and because he believed Trump's lies.
Once again, Cheney ended the hearing by warning about attempts to influence witness testimony, indicating that a witness who had recently testified has received (and ignored) a call from Donald Trump in the last two weeks. Instead, the witness alerted their lawyers, who raised the issue to the committee, which then passed the information to the Justice Department. The committee had previously disclosed efforts by Trump allies to reach a witness who turned out to be Cassidy Hutchinson (from Hearing #6).

Hearing 8.
The most recent — and, for now, final — hearing occurred last night, Thursday, July 21st. In this hearing, the committee focused on Donald Trump's refusal to take any action on January 6 that could have quelled the crowd. The committee emphasized that several witnesses — including Trump's family, his top aides, Fox News personalities, and more — were trying to convince Trump for three hours to take action to calm down the rioters but he refused. Instead, he "poured gasoline on the fire" by encouraging them.
Among other things, the committee focused on witnesses with firsthand accounts and documentary evidence that showed:
	•	Trump did not want to say "stay peaceful" in his tweets, and the Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews (who resigned on January 6) did not think his tweets went far enough to stop the attack.
	•	Trump did not place a single call to law enforcement or national security officials as the attack was unfolding. Gen. Mark Milley expressed astonishment at this fact: “You know, you're the Commander in Chief,” he said in his testimony. “You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America, and there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?"
	•	In never-before-seen outtakes from Trump's January 7 address, he says he does not want to say that the "election is over."
	•	Members of the secret service feared for their lives so much that they placed calls to loved ones.
	•	The committee confirmed in interviews with senior law enforcement, military leaders, the vice president's staff, and D.C. government officials that Trump did not contact anyone that day for help quelling the violence.
Among their new evidence, the committee shared radio chatter from Pence's security detail in which panicked voices can be heard saying "we need to move now" to evacuate Pence, and "if we lose any more time we may lose the ability to do so." The committee also showed video footage immediately following Trump's 2:24pm tweet, in which the crowd becomes noticeably more agitated. It showed outtakes from Trump's January 7 address, in which he is reluctant to say the election is over. It also showed video footage of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), not long after lifting a fist to the crowd in solidarity outside the Capitol, running through the hallways to safety inside the Capitol.
The committee's argument in this hearing was that Trump's dereliction of duty put Congress, Capitol police, and his own vice president in danger. It contrasted his behavior with Vice President Pence's, who was working the phones from inside the Capitol building trying to get assistance. The committee also emphasized that once the rioters breached the Capitol premises, Trump didn't just not call for help, but egged rioters on, tweeting that Mike Pence did not have the courage to act. The hearing covered the 187 minutes between the time Trump called on his supporters to march to the Capitol until he told them all to "go home" in an address where he repeated claims he had actually won the election, but insisted there had to be peace.
Finally, the committee also alluded to evidence partially corroborating the story of Cassidy Hutchinson, in which two witnesses — one a former White House employee and the other a retired Washington, DC, police Sgt. named Mark Robinson — both said Trump had "heated" conversations with secret service and attempted to get them to take him to the Capitol after his rally.
The committee chairs said they will be resuming their hearings in September, but no dates have been set.

The questions. 
With all of this testimony and evidence in mind, it's also worth acknowledging a few of the counterpoints out there.
For starters, as we mentioned at the top, many Trump supporters insist the committee is irredeemably biased. Without any allies of the president on the committee, his team is incapable of calling his own witnesses to counteract any of the testimony that has been heard over the last two months. Among many other things, those criticizing the committee's work focus on a few omissions and facts about the testimony:
	•	At his rally, President Trump calls on supporters to be peaceful. He says, directly, "I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard." He also suggested people get out and vote if Republicans don't fight for him: "If they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight," Trump said. "You primary them. We're going to let you know who they are."
	•	According to The New York Times and Washington Post timelines, the first breach of outer perimeter Capitol barriers was a little before 1 p.m. EST, about 20 minutes before Trump's speech ended. Rioters did not break into the Capitol building until somewhere between 2:11 and 2:16 p.m.. At 2:38 p.m., Trump tweeted his first plea to rioters: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement,” Trump wrote. “They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!” Rather than waiting "three hours," as the committee suggests, Trump's supporters contend he pleaded for peace just 23 minutes after the Capitol was breached.
	•	Members of the committee have conceded they are not corroborating their witness testimony that may undermine their narrative. When Cassidy Hutchinson's story about Trump attempting to grab the steering wheel of The Beast was called into question, and evidence undermined her suggestion about where and when she saw a White House lawyer, the committee's Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) conceded in an interview that the committee did not try to corroborate Hutchinson's testimony. “We never call in witnesses to corroborate other witnesses or to give their reaction to other witnesses,” Lofgren said. But the committee has repeatedly done that when attempting to negatively frame Trump.
	•	The committee has not spent any time probing security failures from the day of January 6. Despite multiple witnesses testifying that they knew violence may be imminent on January 6, there was very little police presence. Trump actually called for National Guard troops to be present, though he believed they'd be there to protect "his people" while other officials worried about armed guards surrounding the Capitol during what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of power. In fact, the outgoing Capitol police chief says he was turned down when suggesting the National Guard protect the Capitol, and that House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, overseen by Pelosi, thought it would be "bad optics."
	•	At least one series of text messages presented to the committee by Adam Schiff were edited on-screen to make it look like a Republican member of Congress was instructing Mark Meadows to have Pence unilaterally throw out votes to overturn an election. But the text messages Schiff presented as screenshots were actually edited to remove context that it was a forwarded message from Washington attorney and former Department of Defense Inspector General Joseph Schmitz. Trump supporters have argued this is just one egregious example of the committee doctoring evidence to negatively frame Republican members of Congress.
	•	There are also still outstanding questions about the day that many want investigated. Namely, what kind of federal law enforcement presence there was, what happened to the purported bombs that were placed around the Capitol, and what deleted text messages from secret service agents reveal from that day (some believe they will undermine testimony we’ve heard so far in the hearings).
Despite all the hype, critics of the January 6 hearing still contend that — at the end of the day — there is no evidence that Donald Trump encouraged rioters to enter the Capitol, to break in, to bring weapons, or to hurt anyone. There is still doubt about whether Trump will personally face any charges, and there is no testimony that he communicated directly or privately with anyone who broke into the Capitol that day. While members of Trump's team have purportedly had contact with violent extremists, one of the few pieces of evidence we have of those contacts was an unnamed White House official rebuffing an attempt to contact the president.

My take.
Reminder: "My take" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. It is meant to be one perspective amid many others. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, you can reply to this email and write to me directly or, if you are a paying subscriber, leave a comment.
In the most concise manner possible, I'm going to try to summarize what we now know about January 6 and the efforts to overturn the election.
As the final returns began to trickle in on election night, several high-ranking officials on Trump's team understood that the race would be tight and the president could lose — and most knew the vote tally could take days to complete. Despite that, Trump responded by prematurely announcing he had won the election, against his aides’ advice. A few days later, when it became increasingly clear Trump was falling behind in critical swing states, his top data analyst informed him he was going to lose. Trump responded by insisting the results were wrong, stolen or corrupted.
Rather than concede his campaign may have failed, Trump used the power of the presidency to try to change the outcome.
Over the course of a few months, he trotted out a team of lawyers who claimed they had evidence of corrupted voting machines (which they never produced). He pressured lawyers at the Justice Department to produce evidence that the election was stolen (which they could not find). He then pressured those officials to state to the public the election was corrupt (which, having no evidence of, they refused to do). Failing to get the Justice Department to act, the president turned his attention to state and federal legislators and officials, including those from critical swing states like Georgia, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
In various calls, the president asked these officials to submit alternate electors, find enough votes via recount to change the election results, refuse to certify election results, or produce legal challenges to election tallies that had already been certified.
Meanwhile, high-ranking members of the president's team produced memos claiming the election was stolen and lawyers drafted multi-pronged plans to send invalid electors to Congress. The fake electors plan was so extensive that they actually met in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin on December 14, 2020. Many of the electors met at the direction of the White House, despite being advised that their plan was illegal.
At one point, the president went as far as suggesting the military seize voting machines, and an executive order to that effect was even drafted (which his lawyers then tried to hide from the committee). As these various efforts to overturn the election failed, the president simultaneously called a rally for January 6 in Washington D.C. — the day the electors were to be ceremonially counted — and began a full-court press on his vice president to halt or derail the counting of those electors (which marks the official conclusion of the election). Trump continued to pressure Pence privately until the morning of January 6, when several aides and the president's own daughter testified to a combative phone call between the two, in which Trump repeatedly questioned Pence's courage because of his refusal to throw the country into a Constitutional crisis.
As Trump delivered his speech on January 6, his supporters began to breach the outer perimeter of the Capitol, at which point Trump concluded his rally and invited those supporters to "peacefully and patriotically" March to Congress and make their voices heard. He then attempted to join them in that march, but the secret service detail guarding the president that day refused. As Trump became aware that his supporters, some of whom he believed to be armed, had breached the Capitol, he first responded by repeating the claim that it was Pence's fault the election was being certified against him. Shortly after, he communicated to his supporters that the police were not their enemy, and asked them to keep the "peace."
After the Capitol building had been breached and ransacked, Trump released a video once again claiming that the election had been stolen, but also insisting his supporters go home. This sort of tightrope walking — where the president was both insisting that the race was stolen but also insisting his supporters not do the rational thing if that were really true (which is to fight the process ) — persisted into the next day. According to several witnesses interviewed by the committee, Trump reluctantly conceded the election had been certified (without saying it was over) for fear that his Cabinet might invoke the 25th amendment and remove him from office.
As I've said before, these transgressions are not all equal. We could debate how many times the president uttered the word "peace" or what person in Trump's orbit had contact with a far-right militia member or whether Trump actually tried to grab the steering wheel of The Beast or if Adam Schiff unfairly edited a text message from Rep. Jim Jordan to make him look as bad as possible.
But all of that is just small potatoes — minor details washed away in a sea of far more serious and incriminating realities laid out above, all of which we have clear evidence for.
The president called Republican state officials in swing states in an obvious attempt to find votes or de-certify elections, which is substantiated by audio recordings and emails. He attempted to weaponize the Justice Department to produce evidence he wanted, so much so that his own appointees threatened to resign, which we have sworn testimony of. And worse than all of that is what we have heard documented evidence of: Trump’s staff produced plans to divert from the legal process of tallying legitimate state electors, and Trump and his team drafted an executive order calling on the military to seize voting machines.
Either or both of those events, with sufficient participation, would have set off a true constitutional crisis and almost certainly a wave of political violence in the streets. Trump and his legal team used every avenue possible to try to keep him in power after he lost an election that was certified and stamped for approval by every state authority responsible for deciding whether elections are free and fair.
I've long resisted the most serious language about Trump and January 6, waiting to see the evidence that was presented, but the sum total of these events — the attempt to use the Justice Department, the desire to illegally seize voting machines, the pressuring of state officials, the creation of fake electors, the pressuring of the vice president — all of it together is closer to an attempted coup than it is to mere sour grapes. And we have a great deal of evidence supporting that narrative.
That’s why a lot of people are changing their minds. Some legal experts now believe Trump may be vulnerable to charges. It has led writers like Batya Ungar-Sargon to concede there was a lot more to learn than she thought. And it’s made people like me feel as if things were a good deal worse than we initially understood — and I always thought it was a disaster.
Again: There are details up for debate. And there are still questions pending about the violence at the Capitol, the involvement of federal law enforcement informants, the extent to which some politicians supported this effort, and how many people involved truly believed the election was stolen.
But it is what was happening out of sight — in the oval office, in Congress, at the state level, and behind closed doors — that is the most damning. It's not a hoax and it's not a witch hunt. It may be deeply political, and Democrats are certainly using every available tool to make their opponents in Congress look as bad as possible, but the actions of the former president and his allies who participated in these schemes didn't make it particularly hard to do.

Quick hits.
	1.	President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid-19 this morning, the White House press secretary announced in a statement. (The test) 
	2.	A bipartisan group of Senators announced a deal to reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887, clarifying that the role of the vice president is symbolic, raising the threshold to object to results from states, and barring states from declaring a "failed election" to override the popular vote. (The deal) 
	3.	Wisconsin's Republican house speaker said that former President Trump has called him "within the last week" seeking to overturn the 2020 election results. (The comments)
	4.	Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, was ordered to testify in a Georgia criminal investigation into election interference. (The testimony) 
	5.	Russia resumed the Nord Stream 1 gas supply to Europe, easing concerns it may shut off Europe's largest natural gas import infrastructure. (The gas)

Today's topic.
Biden's climate change plan. Democrats had hoped to invest as much as $550 billion in their sweeping Build Back Better plan to create new programs to cut emissions and promote the use of technologies like electric vehicles. They eventually narrowed that bill to $300 billion to win Sen. Joe Manchin's (D-WV) support, and there were reports of progress. But last week, Sen. Manchin said he would not support legislation on climate change until he sees the latest inflation numbers. President Biden responded by pledging to push forward via executive action — and hinted at a national emergency declaration to unlock more funds and resources.
On Wednesday, Biden announced his first set of modest executive actions during a visit to Massachusetts, calling for new funding for cooling centers and pushing for off-shore wind projects to produce energy in the Gulf of Mexico. His announcement came in the midst of heat waves across Europe and the U.S. (100 million Americans are under heat warnings this week). He did not declare a climate emergency, as some had predicted he might, though he alluded to the possibility.
"Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world," Biden said. "This is an emergency, an emergency, and I will look at it that way."
If Biden were to declare a national climate emergency, he would unlock a host of new powers and resources, though many are likely to face legal challenges. Climate activists have called on Biden to use his executive authority to pause crude oil exports and offshore drilling as well as to end private investment in fossil fuel projects abroad.
When Donald Trump was president, he controversially used a national emergency act to reallocate military funds to the construction of his border wall, which drew criticism from some Republicans who worried about the precedent such a declaration would set.
“If today the national emergency is border security … tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on CNBC in 2019.
Now, it appears Biden may be considering a similar path. Below, we'll take a look at some arguments about what the Biden administration should do to combat climate change now, with a focus on the possibility that he may declare a climate emergency.

What the right is saying.
	•	The right says declaring an emergency would be an abuse of power, and warns that it would exacerbate Biden's political problems.
	•	Many argue the only path toward combating climate change is a global one.
	•	Others say Democrats need to make their case to the public, not operate through executive action.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board said it would be an "even greater abuse of power" than Trump's repurposing of military funds for a border wall.
"While a President may sometimes need to act with dispatch during an emergency, climate change isn’t close to such an event," the board wrote. "Climate change is neither sudden nor unexpected. The world has warmed by 1.1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century, and the pace of future warming is uncertain and depends on multiple variables. In any case, nothing progressives want Mr. Biden to do will affect the climate or even reduce global CO2 emissions. China and India will continue to build coal plants that offset all of the West’s climate sacrifices... But that isn’t stopping progressives from demanding that Mr. Biden roll over the Constitution’s separation of powers. One irony is that Congress passed the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to limit abuses of executive power.
"Here are some of the ways progressives now want Mr. Biden to impose his climate agenda without democratic assent: Halt oil exports... banning U.S. exports would drive up global oil prices, and the U.S. would still have to import refined products and crude to meet demand," the board said. "Stop oil and gas drilling in the outer continental shelf. Mr. Biden has already imposed a de facto moratorium on new offshore leases, but progressives want him to suspend existing leases. This would reduce U.S. production by about 1.8 million barrels a day—about two to three times as much as Russian output has declined owing to Western sanctions... Use the Defense Production Act to build green energy... While Mr. Biden could try to command manufacturers to make more green products, logistical snags would abound."
Henry Olsen said the United States "cannot stop climate change alone" even if Biden fulfills activists’ climate goals through executive action.
"Fighting climate change effectively and rapidly means doing something that even climate activists often shy away from proposing: starting a global trade war," Olsen wrote. "Emissions in the United States and the European Union are dropping, but standards of living there are being supported by importing products being made more cheaply in other places. This essentially offshores emissions to places with dirtier and cheaper sources of energy, such as coal. That is causing global emissions to rise more quickly than developed countries can cut theirs.
"Rapid decreases in global emissions are therefore only possible by reversing this globalization through border carbon adjustments, or tariffs weighted for the carbon input of imported goods," Olsen added. "Imposing those adjustments without any concern about how it will affect the economies of developing nations would start a trade war that would make Trump’s tariffs look like child’s play. And bailing out those nations through international wealth transfers would likely cause a voter revolt of unimaginable magnitude. Any attempt by Biden to impose such policies under the guise of a climate emergency would be entirely undemocratic."
The New York Post editorial board said it would be one more sign Biden is putting extremist demands from his party's base ahead of democracy.
"The only thing that’s changed on the environment front over the last week is the death of Democrats’ hopes to devote $300 billion in tax credits to green industries," the board said. "Oh, and earlier the Supreme Court finally told the Environmental Protection Agency it couldn’t misread the clear letter of the law to impose costly anti-carbon-emissions mandates on the nation. Neither the tax credits nor the EPA’s rules would have had much immediate impact on climate change (especially since China, India and the developing world continue to vastly increase their emissions). So the only new “emergency” is Democrats’ inability to get their way through normal democratic procedures — that is, winning the majorities in Congress needed to change US laws, by convincing a majority of Americans that drastic action is called for.
"To be clear: The balance of evidence shows that climate change is real, and human activity contributes significantly to it. But the evidence also shows that it’s not remotely apocalyptic: Humanity will be in far better shape by the end of the century even if the world does nothing more to reduce carbon emissions," the board wrote. "Most of the media (and school curricula) push cataclysmic claims about climate change, so the public (especially younger people who’ve been propagandized their entire lives) routinely tells pollsters it’d like the government to act. But that support turns to dust when it comes to most specific steps, which involve huge expenses for small gains: Witness the fury at $4+-a-gallon gas, a direct result of Biden’s (and Western governments’ generally) war on carbon fuels."

What the left is saying.
	•	Many on the left want Biden to take drastic action on climate change.
	•	Most say a climate emergency declaration is necessary, and would show the world Biden is serious.
	•	Others remind us of opportunities to fight climate change with better focused priorities, even without a national emergency.
In The New York Times, Coral Davenport wrote about the four ways the U.S. can still combat climate change without a national emergency declaration.
"Vehicles are the nation’s largest source of planet-warming pollution, and experts say that rapidly ending the use of gasoline-powered cars is crucial to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Mr. Biden has directed the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department to write a transformative new regulation to rein in tailpipe pollution and accelerate the nation’s transition to electric vehicles," Davenport said. "Coal and gas-fired power plants are the nation’s second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. While the Environmental Protection Agency has been blocked by the Supreme Court from issuing a sweeping, ambitious rule that would shut down power plants fueled by coal and gas, the agency still plans to issue a more modest rule that would compel electric utilities to slightly lower their greenhouse emissions, and possibly to install technology to capture and sequester carbon dioxide pollution, although that pricey technology is not yet widely available.
"Focus on methane," Davenport added. "Carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is the planet’s most abundant and dangerous greenhouse gas, but methane, which is emitted into the atmosphere through leaks from oil and gas drilling sites, is a close second. It lingers in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time than carbon dioxide, but packs a bigger punch while it lasts... In the coming months, the E.P.A. plans to issue tougher new regulations to curb leaks of methane from oil and gas wells, a move that could take a significant slice out of the nation’s overall greenhouse gas pollution... Absent federal action on climate change, state-level climate policies will play a more important role. Just under half the states have already enacted significant climate policies. The leader is California, which in the coming weeks is expected to finalize a first-in-the-nation regulation requiring that all new cars sold in the state must be electric or zero-emission by 2035. Seventeen other states are in line to adopt the same rule when it passes in Sacramento."
In Vox, Rebecca Leber wrote about the opportunity to declare an emergency.
"On Wednesday, Biden announced mostly piecemeal actions: $2.3 billion for a FEMA buildings program to combat heat waves and other disasters, releasing guidance for the Low Income Housing Assistance Program to establish programs like community cooling centers, and opening up 700,000 acres for offshore wind energy bids in the Southeast," she wrote. "None of this will fill the gap left by $550 billion in undelivered climate funds in the once-hoped-for reconciliation bill. But Biden faces immense pressure from the left to do a lot more, and to announce it soon. One of the powers Biden could use is his emergency authorities under the National Emergencies Act of 1976.
"Declaring the first-ever climate emergency would show Biden is putting the full weight of the executive branch behind combating the climate crisis, climate advocates argue," Leber said. "In 2021, more than 40 percent of the country lived somewhere hit by a climate-related disaster; even as Biden spoke, more than 100 million Americans were under excessive heat warnings. The Center for Biological Diversity argued in a February report that an emergency declaration would allow the president, among other actions, to use the Defense Production Act to boost renewable manufacturing; use the National Emergencies Act to halt crude oil exports and stop leasing to fossil fuels companies and new drilling offshore; and use the executive branch’s $650 billion procurement budget to buy clean energy and electric vehicles."
After the Supreme Court's ruling limiting the EPA's power, Jean Su and Maya Golden-Krasner argued that Biden could ratchet down oil and gas production.
"Biden can also declare a national climate emergency and reinstate the crude oil export ban that Congress overturned in 2015. Oil drilling in the Permian Basin has exploded since then, creating the Earth’s largest climate bomb," they wrote. "Production quadrupled in the past decade and is expected to grow aggressively in the next, spewing climate- and health-damaging pollution from wellheads to the export terminals built next to low-income communities and those of color. Banning crude oil exports alone could cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 165 million metric tons each year—the equivalent of shuttering 42 coal plants. These are bold climate actions, but we have hope that the Biden administration has the political will to take them on.
"And there is precedent for him to do so. Earlier this year, we wrote a  egal blueprint outlining how the president can deploy his emergency powers to supercharge the transition to a green, just energy system," they argued. "More than 1,200 organizations in the People vs. Fossil Fuels coalition have called on Biden to embrace these powers, declare a national climate emergency, and take swift executive action to reject new fossil fuel leases, infrastructure, and exports. In June, Biden heeded these calls by invoking the Defense Production Act to jump-start renewable-energy manufacturing. In doing so, he signaled a sea change in his administration’s strategy to combat the climate emergency and redress deep-seated inequities. For the first time, he also put our country’s climate strategy on a wartime footing."

My take. 
A few days ago, I saw a funny (if not extremely frustrating) tweet from the writer Matt Walsh. The tweet was an obvious reference to the debate about how to act on climate change.
"Remember when they spent years telling us to panic over the hole in the ozone layer and then suddenly just stopped talking about it and nobody ever mentioned the ozone layer again?" Walsh asked sarcastically. "This was also back during the time when they scared school children into believing that 'acid rain' was a real and urgent threat."
It was funny (and extremely frustrating) because it revealed both the absurdity of our current conversation and the ignorance of some people participating in it.
What is apparently news to Walsh is the reason we "don't talk about" the ozone layer anymore, which is that it has been significantly repaired over the last several decades, primarily because a group of global scientists identified chlorofluorocarbons as being disastrous for the ozone layer. Global leaders believed those scientists, signed the Montreal Protocol, and the use of CFCs fell 99.7%. Over the ensuing years the ozone layer began to repair itself, just as scientists predicted it would. In the U.S., this cooperative process was ushered in by Republican President Ronald Reagan.
The evidence is clear that climate change is a real and urgent threat. I'm heartened to see this consensus building across party lines, even as the debate about what to actually do about it still divides many Americans and our legislators. But it's clear to me that, much like the ozone layer, if we want to "not talk about it" in 40 years, we are going to need cooperative, comprehensive global action.
For starters, I don’t think it’s convincing that “Congress not doing anything” means “Americans don’t want action.” Flawed polling aside, massive surveys from organizations like Pew show that most Americans strongly prefer that our legislators do more to address climate change. 65% of Americans say the federal government is doing too little. 79% favor tax credits to businesses for developing carbon capture and storage. 72% favor government requirements for power companies to transition to sources like wind and solar. 68% favor levying taxes on corporations based on carbon emissions. I was very happy to see Biden re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement precisely because it's the kind of thing most Americans support and the kind of global cooperative agreement that can make a real difference.
Still, I am much less enthusiastic about the idea of a "climate change emergency."
For starters, it would be precisely the kind of abuse of executive action that I've long criticized in this newsletter. I might personally believe this issue is more deserving of executive action than others, but emergency powers are not the right way to combat the problem. On top of being easily reversible by the next president, who as of today looks likely to be a Republican (and thus, someone who will probably overturn the executive orders now being considered), such action would almost certainly face legal hurdles. As the Washington Post put it, some of those legal challenges could affect future environmental regulations — meaning if Biden gets too far out over his skis and gets wrangled by the courts, it could further limit future action.
It's also terrible timing. Most of the fervor on executive actions is to press Biden into cutting back on drilling and oil exports. But politically, that kind of action would probably further depress Biden and Democrats' standing with the public at a time when gas prices are sky high. The latest price drops are a lifeline, and Biden would be foolish to throw that away by taking any executive action that could reverse the trend. If those price drops stick, he may get Sen. Manchin back into the mix. And if progressives are right about Manchin sabotaging the Biden administration, the president still has plenty of other routes to take (more on that in a minute).
It'd also be a horrible time to raid disaster relief funds and send money to renewable projects, just like it was bad business to put that money toward a border wall. Over the last few years, the increasing number of wildfires and major weather events, which are getting worse thanks to extended droughts and rising ocean temperatures, necessitate having those funding sources. While it’s true we want to address the root cause of droughts or rising ocean temperatures, it’s also true that depleting the money allocated for responding to those events is the worst way possible to fund that goal.
If there's one executive action I do support, it's what Biden has already done: Invoking the Defense Production Act to accelerate domestic manufacturing of energy technologies like solar. These are the kinds of things that can expand our clean energy and reduce prices; but it's something Biden has already done, and not something that would require emergency powers.
This administration is facing huge issues over the next few months: Inflation, navigating the war in Ukraine, trying to bring down health care costs, addressing record-high border crossings, staring down monkeypox, and still fighting Covid-19. Resources and attention are limited. The declaration of a national emergency would only create another web of lawsuits and challenges, along with terrible press, all for very little in return.
Instead, the administration should focus its energy on the issues laid out by Davenport: Publish the long-awaited EPA regulations to limit tailpipe emissions and accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (which is already happening, as prices are coming down to the level of typical new cars). Issue the new rule — one that can satisfy the latest Supreme Court ruling — that creates stricter limits on power plant pollution and compels electric utilities to lower their emissions, which is supported by a strong majority of Americans. Place major restrictions on methane, which legal experts believe would have a strong chance to withstand legal challenges. And, finally, lean into the state action, where much of the most wide-reaching climate change work is already being done.
Biden could also take the more controversial step of embracing an expansion of nuclear energy (and investment in the research of nuclear energy), which would both have huge climate benefits and draw support from across the aisle. We are already the top nuclear energy producer in the world and we could continue to lead the way. If we are truly to treat climate change as a global emergency, we need to embrace all the options we have that help get us to net-zero emissions, and beyond. I know nuclear energy is controversial, and addressing that in a separate issue is something that is probably long overdue, so please let me know your thoughts ahead of time. But personally, I don’t see a way the U.S. meets its goals that doesn’t include nuclear power.
For all the doomsday talk, the Biden administration has already taken some positive steps — through the infrastructure bill and executive action — on climate change. There are plenty of other options on the table that should be prioritized before a national emergency is used to ban the export of oil and pause offshore drilling. Especially if, as some advisors to the president and many Democrats believe, Manchin may come back to the table on climate change legislation in the fall.
Even without him, though, the president is in no position to take risky, sweeping, legally dubious executive action before he checks all the other boxes of what he can do right now.

Your questions, answered.
Q: Why don’t the Democrats/liberals broadcast their ideas more vocally and as often as the Republican/conservatives do? Especially the President. He should get on TV and all social media the way that that other guy did.
— Kyle, Orlando, Florida
Tangle: I'm not really sure. I think there are two potential answers: One, they know some of their major positions are unpopular and they don't want to defend them publicly, which is true of both political parties. Two, President Biden has not been very good in televised interviews or in scrums with reporters, and they worry that putting him on TV all day could result in a lot of gaffes and missteps.
Frankly, I think Democrats are very weak messengers, especially compared to Donald Trump and his administration. For instance, in our "story that matters" from Monday, I noted how Biden had secured a deal for $1.5 billion of funding from Mexico on border infrastructure. That story was six days old. I am a political reporter and somehow missed it. It's possible that was just a random lapse in my own news consumption, but I scoured both of Biden's Twitter pages and found no mention of the deal.
Perhaps Democrats don't want to promote "border security" agreements. But that seems foolish to me. If it were President Trump, he would have talked about securing this money nonstop for 48 hours every chance he got. Remember, Trump promised to get Mexico to pay for his border wall but never actually got a dime. Imagine if he had secured $1.5 billion? How Biden's team hasn't leveraged this to show off to the many Americans who care about border security is astounding — he didn't even spare a single tweet.
I say this often, but yes: I agree. I think Democrats and Republicans have the majorities on their side on a few huge wedge issues, but I think Republicans are a lot better at broadcasting and articulating those positions than Democrats are. And when they make progress toward something they know is popular, they are much better at celebrating it.

A story that matters.
Sales of existing home prices fell 5.4% in June, dropping for a fifth consecutive month, while home prices hit a record median of $416,000. The U.S. housing market is now rapidly cooling as prices have risen alongside mortgage rates, which has slowed down home sales. The slower activity is one sign of a potential recession. “A combination of higher prices and higher mortgage rates have clearly shifted the dynamics in the housing market,” Lawrence Yun, National Association of Realtors chief economist, told The Wall Street Journal. “People who want to buy are simply priced out given the affordability challenges.” The Wall Street Journal has the story.

Numbers. 
	•	$8 billion. The amount of money the Biden administration has already put aside to lower household energy costs.
	•	700,000. The amount, in acres, of offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico the Biden administration is proposing for wind energy infrastructure.
	•	3 million. The number of homes that could be powered by the wind energy projects in those areas.
	•	6%. The rise in global energy-related carbon emissions in 2021 from the previous year.
	•	36.3 billion tonnes. The amount of global CO₂ emissions in 2021, the highest annual amount ever recorded.
	•	40%. The percentage of overall CO₂ emissions growth across the globe that came from coal.

Have a nice day.
In Dubai, the world's largest vertical farm is now under construction. A city known for importing almost all of its produce due to the arid conditions and limited water is now going to construct a giant vertical farm that can grow 2 million pounds of leafy greens each year. Emirates Flight Catering is partnering with Boston-based Crop One to build a 333,000 square foot facility to house growing lettuce, arugula, spinach and mixed greens. The farm uses 95% less water than required for growing in a field, with no herbicides or pesticides. The lighting, humidity and nutrients are all tracked with artificial intelligence. Thred.com has the story.

   We believe travel can change the world. For good. Learn more about our Flight to Net ZeroSM at delta.com/sustainability.  Terms & Conditions  This ticket is non-refundable unless the original ticket was issued at a fully refundable fare. Some fares may not allow changes. If allowed, any change to your itinerary may require payment of a change fee and increased fare. Failure to appear for any flight without notice to Delta will result in cancellation of your remaining reservation.  Note: When using certain vouchers to purchase tickets, remaining credits may not be refunded. Additional charges and/or credits may apply.  Fare Details: FLL DL SLC450.23HA0QA0MQ USD450.23END ZP FLL XF FLL4.5   †All SkyMiles® program rules apply. To review the rules, see Membership Guide & Program Rules. Taxes and fees for Award Travel are the responsibility of the passenger and must be paid at the time the ticket is booked. Award Travel seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or in all markets. Offers void where prohibited by law. Other restrictions may apply.   Checked Bag Allowance  *On Delta® operated flights, you may carry on one bag and a small personal item at no charge.  Delta One®/First/Business Class weight allowance reverts to 50 lbs for all checked bags beyond regular free allowance.  At the time of check in with Delta, SkyMiles Medallion members, SkyTeam Elite & Elite Plus and active US Military personnel are eligible for fee waivers and other benefits. For more details, visit delta.com/baggage. Basic Cardmembers with a Gold, Platinum, or Reserve Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express are eligible for the first bag fee waiver. More details on the program can be found at delta.com/firstbagfree  A standard checked bag with Delta may be up to 50 lbs and 62 linear inches (per piece). Additional fees apply for oversize, overweight, and/or additional pieces of checked baggage. Please review Delta's baggage guidelines for details. Weight and size restrictions may vary when checking baggage on carriers other than Delta. Contact with the operating carrier for detailed checked baggage allowances. You must be checked in at the gate by the applicable check-in deadlines or your reservation may be cancelled. Please review Delta's check-in requirement guidelines for details. Check-in requirements vary by airline, so if your ticket includes travel on other airlines, please check with the operating carrier on your ticket.  Do you have comments about our service? Please email us to share them.  ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY  Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a carrier’s own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.  Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  Conditions of Carriage  Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:  • Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage. • Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us. • Our right to change terms of the contract. • Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage. • Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting. • Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.  These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you. You may view these conditions of carriage on delta.com, or by requesting a copy from Delta.  You have received this email because you elected to receive your Electronic Ticket receipt sent to you via email. If you would like to take advantage of other Delta email programs featuring special fares, promotions, information and flight updates, please visit: delta.com/emailprograms or delta.com/notifications  This document establishes the creation of your electronic EMD(S) in our computer systems. It does not constitute a document of carriage. Where this document is issued for transportation or services other than passenger air transportation, specific terms and conditions may apply. These terms and conditions may be provided separately or may be obtained from the issuing agent.   Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:  If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (www.delta.com/appr) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.  Si l’embarquement vous est refusé, ou si votre vol est annulé ou retardé d’au moins deux heures ou si vos bagages sont perdus ou endommagés, vous pourriez avoir droit au titre du Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens, à certains avantages au titre des normes de traitement applicables et à une indemnité. Pour de plus amples renseignements sur vos droits, veuillez communiquer avec votre transporteur aérien ( www.delta.com/appr) ou visiter le site Web de l’Office des transports du Canada.  COPYRIGHT INFORMATION  This email message and its contents are copyrighted and are proprietary products of Delta Air Lines, Inc.
